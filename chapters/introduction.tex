\section{Active Matter and Active Fluids}
\label{active-fluids}

Active matter denotes a large group of active units which utilize ambient energy to achieve motions. Examples include flocking birds, schooling fish, herding beasts and even human crowds, down to actin filaments powered by motor proteins, bacteria and chemical reaction driven particles
\cite{Toner2005, Ramaswamy2010, Vicsek2012, Marchetti2013, Saintillan2013, Bechinger2016, Julicher2007}. The concept roots from a broader class of matter: soft matter, which includes polymers, surfactants and colloidal grains and shares common properties such as complexity and flexibility
\cite{DeGennes1992}. Like soft matter, active matter is also complex and flexible. What makes them more complex is the self-propulsion of each individual constituent, which endows them with more intrguing and counter-intuitive properties, challenging our understandings \cite{Glotzer2015}.

% such as abnormal rheology and emergent self-organized collective phenomena

Active fluids are suspensions of active agents such as cells, particles and biological macromolecules that are capable of utilizing chemical energy to sustain their self-propulsion. "fluids" in the name suggests the important role of the viscous hydrodynamic interaction and stress in the systems of interest. The first glimmering of active fluids dates back to 1969, when Finlayson and Scriven found that motion could spontaneously set in a previously still material without the intervention of outside forces, due to composition-dependent stress \cite{Finlayson1969}. However, the study on active fluids did not bloom, until 26 year later, when the seminal paper on modeling collective flocks came out \cite{Vicsek1995}. From then on, physicists are getting unprecedentedly intereted in biological phenomena, leading to the emergence of a new field of study - active fluids.

Early accomplishments in the research of active fluids include two successful theoretical predictions on the abnormal rheology and the spontaneous active turbulence \cite{Hatwalne2004, Simha2002}, which were then demonstrated in multiple experiments
\cite{Dombroski2004, Wensink2012, Rafai2020, Sokolov2009, Gachelin2013, Lopez2015}. From these beginnings, the field has been enjoying a vibrant interplay between experiment and theory, and more complex environment and geometrical constraints have been investigated \cite{Ramaswamy2019}. The study of active fluids has provided us with a good qualitative understanding of some biological processes, such as how active turbulence enhances nutrient transport.

%% A quatitative understanding, however, requires more knowledge on the chemical and biological signalling



The research on collective phenomena dates back to the 1980s, when flocking birds, schooling fish, herding beasts and even human crowds (Fig.~\ref{fig:1-1}a-c) were regarded as an orientationally ordered phase of living matter, in analogy with ferromagnetic spins
\cite{Reynolds1987, Vicsek1995, Narayan2007, Ward2008, Ballerini2008, Silverberg2013}. This idea has since evoked enormous research interest. More recently, besides macroscopic systems, smaller and more laboratory accessible model systems have joined. As examples, actin filaments powered by motor proteins and bacteria exhibit turbulence-like swirling patterns, and synthetic active colloids form dynamic clusters
\cite{Dunkel2013, Wensink2012, Buttinoni2013, Palacci2013, Sanchez2012, Schaller2010, Sokolov2007}. Observations have revealed that most patterns of collective motion are universal in different systems. As of today, these universal patterns can be qualitatively reproduced by simple models with collision rules and noise. And quantitative description is developing with more observations available, which is bound to have impactful applications, including understanding the reaction of panic crowd and predicting the migration of fish schools
\cite{Vicsek2012}.

\section{Novel Properties}
\label{emergent-properties}
Active fluids exhibit novel properties such as enhanced diffusion and reduced viscosity \cite{Ramaswamy2010}. The enhanced diffusion is attributed to the interaction - steric collision or hydrodynamic perturbation - between tracer particles and active agents (swimmers)
\cite{Wu2000, Peng2016, Caspi2000, Morozov2014, Patteson2016, Leptos2009,
 Yang2016, Valeriani2011, Kurtuldu2011}.
And the reduced viscosity is explained by hydrodynamic stress and swim stress \cite{}. In this section, the existing works regarding these novel properties are reviewed, and motivations for investigating the rheology of bacterial suspensions under confinement (Sec.~\ref{rheology-of-bacterial-suspensions-under-confinement}) will be discussed.


\section{Rheology}
Polystyrene spherical tracer particles, typically a few microns across, show higher diffusivity in bacterial suspensions and active microtubules \cite{Wu2000, Caspi2000}.
