\textbf{Illustrations of giant number fluctuations.}
(a)-(b) a 2-particle system and a 3-particle system, along with the probabilities and the standard deviations of each configuration.
(c) The most extreme configuration of 2-particle and 3-particle systems.
(d) Number fluctuation curves, where standard deviation of number of particles rescaled by the square root of mean number $\Delta N/\sqrt N$ is plotted against the mean number $N$. The scaling exponent of these curves, denoted as $\alpha$, measures the magnitude of GNF.
