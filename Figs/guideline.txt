1. All raw material of images are put in the same folder as the final figure. They are named as "{number}{letter}". {number} is the figure number in a section. 
For raw materials, {letter} will be letters a-z, to differentiate one from others. For the final figure, {letter} will be omit. 
Thus, the final figure will always be named "1.pdf", "2.pdf", etc..

2. I stop using ppt as template. Instead, .svg is used with Inkscape to maximize the support for vector graphics. 
A .svg template is created in Figs folder, with letter paper page setting and two guides to indicate viable area.
