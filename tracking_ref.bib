The text provides evaluations of sensor management, kinematic and attribute data processing, data association, situation assessment, and modern tracking and data fusion methods as applied in both military and non-military arenas. The book offers full coverage of tracking topics such as passive ranging and interactive multiple model (IMM) filtering; multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) data association; Bayesian and Dempster-Shafer attribute fusion; multiple sensor tracking methods for distributed systems such as space-based surveillance systems; use of tracking data for situation assessment and sensor management; track fusion and track-before-detect (TBD) methods; and efficient allocation of agile beam radar resources. It also covers the interpretation and optimization of tracker data, and solves the problems associated with algorithm choice and design.},

abstract = {Particle tracking is of key importance for quantitative analysis of intracellular dynamic processes from time-lapse microscopy image data. Because manually detecting and following large numbers of individual particles is not feasible, automated computational methods have been developed for these tasks by many groups. Aiming to perform an objective comparison of methods, we gathered the community and organized an open competition in which participating teams applied their own methods independently to a commonly defined data set including diverse scenarios. Performance was assessed using commonly defined measures. Although no single method performed best across all scenarios, the results revealed clear differences between the various approaches, leading to notable practical conclusions for users and developers. {\textcopyright} 2014 Nature America, Inc.},

abstract = {With the many modes of live cell fluorescence imaging made possible by the rapid advances of fluorescent protein technology, researchers begin to face a new challenge: How to transform the vast amounts of unstructured image data into quantitative information for the discovery of new cell behaviors and the rigorous testing of mechanistic hypotheses? Although manual and semiautomatic computer-assisted image analysis are still used extensively, the demand for more reproducible and complete image measurements of complex cellular dynamics increases the need for fully automatic computational image processing approaches for both mechanistic studies and screening applications in cell biology. This chapter provides an overview of the issues that arise with the use of computational algorithms in live cell imaging studies, with particular emphasis on the close coordination of sample preparation, image acquisition, and computational image analysis. It also aims to introduce the terminology and central concepts of computer vision to facilitate the communication between cell biologists and computer scientists in collaborative imaging projects. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Achieving complete understanding of any living thing inevitably requires thorough analysis of both its anatomic and dynamic properties. Live-cell imaging experiments carried out to this end often produce massive amounts of time-lapse image data containing far more information than can be digested by a human observer. Computerized image analysis offers the potential to take full advantage of available data in an efficient and reproducible manner. A recurring task in many experiments is the tracking of large numbers of cells or particles and the analysis of their (morpho)dynamic behavior. In the past decade, many methods have been developed for this purpose, and software tools based on these are increasingly becoming available. Here, we survey the latest developments in this area and discuss the various computational approaches, software tools, and quantitative measures for tracking and motion analysis of cells and particles in time-lapse microscopy images. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

It has become evident that in order to take full advantage of the potential wealth of information hidden in the data produced by even a single experiment, visual inspection and manual analysis are no longer adequate. To ensure efficiency, consistency, and completeness in data processing and analysis, computational tools are essential. Of particular importance to many modern live-cell imaging experiments is the ability to automatically track and analyze the motion of objects in time-lapse microscopy images.

abstract = {Particle tracking is a powerful biophysical tool that requires conversion of large video files into position time series, i.e., traces of the species of interest for data analysis. Current tracking methods, based on a limited set of input parameters to identify bright objects, are ill-equipped to handle the spectrum of spatiotemporal heterogeneity and poor signal-to-noise ratios typically presented by submicron species in complex biological environments. Extensive user involvement is frequently necessary to optimize and execute tracking methods, which is not only inefficient but introduces user bias. To develop a fully automated tracking method, we developed a convolutional neural network for particle localization from image data, comprising over 6,000 parameters, and used machine learning techniques to train the network on a diverse portfolio of video conditions. The neural network tracker provides unprecedented automation and accuracy, with exceptionally low false positive and false negative rates on both 2D and 3D simulated videos and 2D experimental videos of difficult-to-track species.},

abstract = {Our goal is to represent a given 2D shape with an automatically determined number of ellipses, so that the total area covered by the ellipses is equal to the area of the original shape without any assumption or prior knowledge about the object structure. To solve this interesting theoretical problem, first we employ the skeleton of the 2D shape which provides important information on the parameters of the ellipses that could approximate the original shape. For a given number of such ellipses, the hard Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm is employed to maximise the shape coverage under the Equal Area constraint. Different models (i.e., solutions involving different numbers of ellipses) are evaluated based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). This considers a novel, entropy-based shape complexity measure that balances the model complexity and the model approximation error. In order to minimise the AIC criterion, two variants are proposed and evaluated: (a) the augmentative method that gradually increases the number of considered ellipses starting from a single one and (b) the decremental method that decreases the number of ellipses starting from a large, automatically defined set. The obtained quantitative results on more than 4000 2D shapes included in standard as well as in custom datasets, quantify the performance of the proposed methods and illustrate that their solutions agree with human intuition.},

abstract = {We present TrackMate, an open source Fiji plugin for the automated, semi-automated, and manual tracking of single-particles. It offers a versatile and modular solution that works out of the box for end users, through a simple and intuitive user interface. It is also easily scriptable and adaptable, operating equally well on 1D over time, 2D over time, 3D over time, or other single and multi-channel image variants. TrackMate provides several visualization and analysis tools that aid in assessing the relevance of results. The utility of TrackMate is further enhanced through its ability to be readily customized to meet specific tracking problems. TrackMate is an extensible platform where developers can easily write their own detection, particle linking, visualization or analysis algorithms within the TrackMate environment. This evolving framework provides researchers with the opportunity to quickly develop and optimize new algorithms based on existing TrackMate modules without the need of having to write de novo user interfaces, including visualization, analysis and exporting tools. The current capabilities of TrackMate are presented in the context of three different biological problems. First, we perform Caenorhabditis-elegans lineage analysis to assess how light-induced damage during imaging impairs its early development. Our TrackMate-based lineage analysis indicates the lack of a cell-specific light-sensitive mechanism. Second, we investigate the recruitment of NEMO (NF-$\kappa$B essential modulator) clusters in fibroblasts after stimulation by the cytokine IL-1 and show that photodamage can generate artifacts in the shape of TrackMate characterized movements that confuse motility analysis. Finally, we validate the use of TrackMate for quantitative lifetime analysis of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in plant cells.},
