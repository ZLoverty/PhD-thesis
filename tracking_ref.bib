Current tracking methods, based on a limited set of input parameters to identify bright objects, are ill-equipped to handle the spectrum of spatiotemporal heterogeneity and poor signal-to-noise ratios typically presented by submicron species in complex biological environments. Extensive user involvement is frequently necessary to optimize and execute tracking methods, which is not only inefficient but introduces user bias. To develop a fully automated tracking method, we developed a convolutional neural network for particle localization from image data, comprising over 6,000 parameters, and used machine learning techniques to train the network on a diverse portfolio of video conditions. The neural network tracker provides unprecedented automation and accuracy, with exceptionally low false positive and false negative rates on both 2D and 3D simulated videos and 2D experimental videos of difficult-to-track species.},

abstract = {Our goal is to represent a given 2D shape with an automatically determined number of ellipses, so that the total area covered by the ellipses is equal to the area of the original shape without any assumption or prior knowledge about the object structure. To solve this interesting theoretical problem, first we employ the skeleton of the 2D shape which provides important information on the parameters of the ellipses that could approximate the original shape. For a given number of such ellipses, the hard Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm is employed to maximise the shape coverage under the Equal Area constraint. Different models (i.e., solutions involving different numbers of ellipses) are evaluated based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). This considers a novel, entropy-based shape complexity measure that balances the model complexity and the model approximation error. In order to minimise the AIC criterion, two variants are proposed and evaluated: (a) the augmentative method that gradually increases the number of considered ellipses starting from a single one and (b) the decremental method that decreases the number of ellipses starting from a large, automatically defined set. The obtained quantitative results on more than 4000 2D shapes included in standard as well as in custom datasets, quantify the performance of the proposed methods and illustrate that their solutions agree with human intuition.},

It is also easily scriptable and adaptable, operating equally well on 1D over time, 2D over time, 3D over time, or other single and multi-channel image variants. TrackMate provides several visualization and analysis tools that aid in assessing the relevance of results. The utility of TrackMate is further enhanced through its ability to be readily customized to meet specific tracking problems. TrackMate is an extensible platform where developers can easily write their own detection, particle linking, visualization or analysis algorithms within the TrackMate environment. This evolving framework provides researchers with the opportunity to quickly develop and optimize new algorithms based on existing TrackMate modules without the need of having to write de novo user interfaces, including visualization, analysis and exporting tools. The current capabilities of TrackMate are presented in the context of three different biological problems. First, we perform Caenorhabditis-elegans lineage analysis to assess how light-induced damage during imaging impairs its early development. Our TrackMate-based lineage analysis indicates the lack of a cell-specific light-sensitive mechanism. Second, we investigate the recruitment of NEMO (NF-$\kappa$B essential modulator) clusters in fibroblasts after stimulation by the cytokine IL-1 and show that photodamage can generate artifacts in the shape of TrackMate characterized movements that confuse motility analysis. Finally, we validate the use of TrackMate for quantitative lifetime analysis of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in plant cells.},

Here we present a tracking algorithm that addresses the principal challenges of SPT, namely high particle density, particle motion heterogeneity, temporary particle disappearance, and particle merging and splitting. The algorithm first links particles between consecutive frames and then links the resulting track segments into complete trajectories. Both steps are formulated as global combinatorial optimization problems whose solution identifies the overall most likely set of particle trajectories throughout a movie. Using this approach, we show that the GTPase dynamin differentially affects the kinetics of long- and short-lived endocytic structures and that the motion of CD36 receptors along cytoskeleton-mediated linear tracks increases their aggregation probability. Both applications indicate the requirement for robust and complete tracking of dense particle fields to dissect the mechanisms of receptor organization at the level of the plasma membrane.},

abstract = {Quantitative analysis of biological image data generally involves the detection of many subresolution spots. Especially in live cell imaging, for which fluorescence microscopy is often used, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be extremely low, making automated spot detection a very challenging task. In the past, many methods have been proposed to perform this task, but a thorough quantitative evaluation and comparison of these methods is lacking in the literature. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of the most frequently used detection methods for this purpose. These include seven unsupervised and two supervised methods. We perform experiments on synthetic images of three different types, for which the ground truth was available, as well as on real image data sets acquired for two different biological studies, for which we obtained expert manual annotations to compare with. The results from both types of experiments suggest that for very low SNRs 2), the supervised (machine learning) methods perform best overall. Of the unsupervised methods, the detectors based on the so-called h-dome transform from mathematical morphology or the multiscale variance-stabilizing transform perform comparably, and have the advantage that they do not require a cumbersome learning stage. At high SNRs ({\textgreater} 5), the difference in performance of all considered detectors becomes negligible. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {When a container is set in motion, the free surface of the liquid starts to oscillate or slosh. Such effects can be observed when a glass of water is handled carelessly and the fluid sloshes or even spills over the rims of the container. However, beer does not slosh as readily as water, which suggests that foam could be used to damp sloshing. In this work, we study experimentally the effect on sloshing of a liquid foam placed on top of a liquid bath. We generate a monodisperse two-dimensional liquid foam in a rectangular container and track the motion of the foam. The influence of the foam on the sloshing dynamics is experimentally characterized: only a few layers of bubbles are sufficient to significantly damp the oscillations. We rationalize our experimental findings with a model that describes the foam contribution to the damping coefficient through viscous dissipation on the walls of the container. Then we extend our study to confined three-dimensional liquid foam and observe that the behavior of 2D and confined 3D systems are very similar. Thus, we conclude that only the bubbles close to the walls have a significant impact on the dissipation of energy. The possibility to damp liquid sloshing using foam is promising in numerous industrial applications such as the transport of liquefied gas in tankers or for propellants in rocket engines.},

@article{Newby2018,
abstract = {Particle tracking is a powerful biophysical tool that requires conversion of large video files into position time series, i.e., traces of the species of interest for data analysis. Current tracking methods, based on a limited set of input parameters to identify bright objects, are ill-equipped to handle the spectrum of spatiotemporal heterogeneity and poor signal-to-noise ratios typically presented by submicron species in complex biological environments. Extensive user involvement is frequently necessary to optimize and execute tracking methods, which is not only inefficient but introduces user bias. To develop a fully automated tracking method, we developed a convolutional neural network for particle localization from image data, comprising over 6,000 parameters, and used machine learning techniques to train the network on a diverse portfolio of video conditions. The neural network tracker provides unprecedented automation and accuracy, with exceptionally low false positive and false negative rates on both 2D and 3D simulated videos and 2D experimental videos of difficult-to-track species.},

@article{Moen2019,
abstract = {Recent advances in computer vision and machine learning underpin a collection of algorithms with an impressive ability to decipher the content of images. These deep learning algorithms are being applied to biological images and are transforming the analysis and interpretation of imaging data. These advances are positioned to render difficult analyses routine and to enable researchers to carry out new, previously impossible experiments. Here we review the intersection between deep learning and cellular image analysis and provide an overview of both the mathematical mechanics and the programming frameworks of deep learning that are pertinent to life scientists. We survey the field's progress in four key applications: image classification, image segmentation, object tracking, and augmented microscopy. Last, we relay our labs' experience with three key aspects of implementing deep learning in the laboratory: annotating training data, selecting and training a range of neural network architectures, and deploying solutions. We also highlight existing datasets and implementations for each surveyed application.},
