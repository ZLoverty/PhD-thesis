The behavioral responses to light were studied in E. coli carrying a hemH mutation. It was shown that the hemH mutant displayed a tumbling response upon illumination and a running response upon removal of the light. The most effective light to induce a tumbling response in the hemH mutant was blue light (396450 nm). The chemotaxis machinery was needed for the light-induced tumbling response in the hemH mutant. The bacterial defect is an analog of the human inherited disease erythropoietic protoporphyria.},

Biochemical analyses demonstrate that phytochrome is an ancient molecule that evolved from a more compact light censor in cyanobacteria. The cyanobacterial phytochrome Cph1 is a light-regulated histidine kinase that mediates red, far-red reversible phosphorylation of a small response regulator, Rcp1 (response regulator for cyanobacterial phytochrome), encoded by the adjacent gene, thus implicating protein phosphorylation-dephosphorylation in the initial step of light signal transduction by phytochrome.},

abstract = {Photoisomerization of the retinal of bacteriorhodopsin initiates a cyclic reaction in which a proton is translocated across the membrane. Studies of this protein promise a better understanding of how ion pumps function. Together with a large amount of spectroscopic and mutational data, the atomic structure of bacteriorhodopsin, determined in the last decade at increasing resolutions, has suggested plausible but often contradictory mechanisms. X-ray diffraction of bacteriorhodopsin crystals grown in cubic lipid phase revealed unexpected two-fold symmetries that indicate merohedral twinning along the crystallographic c axis. The structure, refined to 2.3 angstroms taking this twinning into account, is different from earlier models, including that most recently reported. One of the carboxyl oxygen atoms of the proton acceptor Asp85 is connected to the proton donor, the retinal Schiff base,t hrough a hydrogen-bonded water and forms a second hydrogen bond with another water. The other carboxyl oxygen atom of Asp85 accepts a hydrogen bond from Thr89. This structure forms the active site. The nearby Arg82 is the center of a network of numerous hydrogen-bonded residues and an ordered water molecule. This network defines the pathway of the proton from the buried Schiff base to the extracellular surface.},

So far, bacteriorhodopsins capable of generating a chemiosmotic membrane potential in response to light have been demonstrated only in halophitic archaea. We describe here a type of rhodopsin derived from bacteria that was discovered through genomic analyses of naturally occuring marine bacterioplankton. The bacterial rhodopsin was encoded in the genome of an uncultivated $\gamma$-proteobacterium and shared highest amino acid sequence similarity with archaeal rhodopsins. The protein was functionally expressed in Escherichia coli and bound retinal to form an active, light-driven proton pump. The new rhodopsin exhibited a photochemical reaction cycle with intermediates and kinetics characteristic of archaeal proton-pumping rhodopsins. Our results demonstrate that archaeal-like rhodopsins are broadly distributed among different taxa, including members of the domain Bacteria. Our data also indicate that a previously unsuspected mode of bacterially mediated light-driven energy generation may commonly occur in oceanic surface waters worldwide.},

abstract = {Bacteriorhodopsin, a membrane protein with a relative molecular mass of 27,000, is a light driven pump which transports protons across the cell membrane of the halophilic organism Halobacterium salinarum. The chromophore retinal is covalently attached to the protein via a protonated Schiff base. Upon illumination, retinal is isomerized. The Schiff base then releases a proton to the extracellular medium, and is subsequently reprotonated from the cytoplasm. An atomic model for bacteriorhodopsin was first determined by Henderson et al, and has been confirmed and extended by work in a number of laboratories in the last few years. Here we present an atomic model for structural changes involved in the vectorial, light-driven transport of protons by bacteriorhodopsin. A 'switch' mechanism ensures the vectorial nature of pumping. First, retinal unbends, triggered by loss of the Schiff base proton, and second, a protein conformational change occurs. This conformational change, which we have determined by electron crystallography at atomic (3.2 {\AA} in-plane and 3.6 {\AA} vertical) resolution, is largely localized to helices F and G, and provides an 'opening' of the protein to protons on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane.},

abstract = {Proteorhodopsin (PR) is a retinal-binding bacterial integral membrane protein that functions as a light-driven proton pump. The gene encoding this photoprotein was originally discovered on a large genome fragment derived from an uncultured marine $\gamma$- proteobacterium of the SAR86 group. Subsequently, many variants of the PR gene have been detected in marine plankton, via PCR-based gene surveys. It has not been clear, however, whether these different PR genes are widely distributed among different bacterial groups, or whether they have a restricted taxonomic distribution. We report here comparative analyses of PR-bearing genomic fragments recovered directly from planktonic bacteria inhabiting the California coast, the central Pacific Ocean, and waters offshore the Antarctica Peninsula. Sequence analysis of an Antarctic genome fragment harboring PR (ANT32C12) revealed moderate conservation in gene order and identity, compared with a previously reported PR-containing genome fragment from a Monterey Bay $\gamma$-proteobacterium (EBAC31A08). Outside the limited region of synteny shared between these clones, however, no significant DNA or protein identity was evident. Analysis of a third PR-containing genome fragment (HOT2C01) from the North Pacific subtropical gyre showed even more divergence from the $\gamma$-proteobacterial PR-flanking region. Subsequent phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyses revealed that the Central North Pacific PR-containing genome fragment (HOT2C01) originated from a planktonic $\alpha$-proteobacterium. These data indicate that PR genes are distributed among a variety of divergent marine bacterial taxa, including both $\alpha$- and $\gamma$-proteobacteria. Our analyses also demonstrate the utility of cultivation-independent comparative genomic approaches for assessing gene content and distribution in naturally occurring microbes.},

abstract = {Proteorhodopsin (PR) is a light-powered proton pump identified by community sequencing of ocean samples. Previous studies have established the ecological distribution and enzymatic activity of PR, but its role in powering cells and participation in ocean energy fluxes remains unclear. Here, we show that when cellular respiration is inhibited by depleting oxygen or by the respiratory poison azide, Escherichia coli cells expressing PR become light-powered. Illumination of these cells with light coinciding with PR's absorption spectrum creates a proton motive force (pmf) that turns the flagellar motor, yielding cells that swim when illuminated with green light. By measuring the pmf of individual illuminated cells, we quantify the coupling between light-driven and respiratory proton currents, estimate the Michaelis-Menten constant (K m) of PR (103 photons per second/nm2), and show that light-driven pumping by PR can fully replace respiration as a cellular energy source in some environmental conditions. Moreover, sunlight-illuminated PR+ cells are less sensitive to azide than PR cells, consistent with PR+ cells possessing an alternative means of maintaining cellular pmf and, thus, viability. Proteorhodopsin allows Escherichia coli cells to withstand environmental respiration challenges by harvesting light energy. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Genetically encodable optical reporters, such as green fluorescent protein, have revolutionized the observation and measurement of cellular states. However, the inverse challenge of using light to control precisely cellular behaviour has only recently begun to be addressed; semi-synthetic chromophore-tethered receptors and naturally occurring channel rhodopsins have been used to perturb directly neuronal networks. The difficulty of engineering light-sensitive proteins remains a significant impediment to the optical control of most cell-biological processes. Here we demonstrate the use of a new genetically encoded light-control system based on an optimized, reversible proteinĝ€"protein interaction from the phytochrome signalling network of Arabidopsis thaliana. Because proteinĝ€"protein interactions are one of the most general currencies of cellular information, this system can, in principle, be generically used to control diverse functions. Here we show that this system can be used to translocate target proteins precisely and reversibly to the membrane with micrometre spatial resolution and at the second timescale. We show that light-gated translocation of the upstream activators of Rho-family GTPases, which control the actin cytoskeleton, can be used to precisely reshape and direct the cell morphology of mammalian cells. The light-gated proteinĝ€"protein interaction that has been optimized here should be useful for the design of diverse light-programmable reagents, potentially enabling a new generation of perturbative, quantitative experiments in cell biology. {\textcopyright} 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

PPRs use light energy to generate an outward proton flux, and the resulting proton motive force can subsequently power cellular processes. Recently, the introduction of PPRs in microbial production hosts has successfully led to light-driven biotechnological conversions.

abstract = {Light-switchable proteins enable unparalleled control of molecular biological processes in live organisms. Previously, we have engineered red/far-red and green/red photoreversible two-component signal transduction systems (TCSs) with transcriptional outputs in E. coli and used them to characterize and control synthetic gene circuits with exceptional quantitative, temporal, and spatial precision. However, the broad utility of these light sensors is limited by bulky DNA encoding, incompatibility with commonly used ligand-responsive transcription factors, leaky output in deactivating light, and less than 10-fold dynamic range. Here, we compress the four genes required for each TCS onto two streamlined plasmids and replace all chemically inducible and evolved promoters with constitutive, engineered versions. Additionally, we systematically optimize the expression of each sensor histidine kinase and response regulator, and redesign both pathway output promoters, resulting in low leakiness and 72- and 117-fold dynamic range, respectively. These second-generation light sensors can be used to program the expression of more genes over a wider range and can be more easily combined with additional plasmids or moved to different host strains. This work demonstrates that bacterial TCSs can be optimized to function as high-performance sensors for scientific and engineering applications. (Figure Presented).},

In this procedure, recombination requires the phage $\lambda$ Red recombinase, which is synthesized under the control of an inducible promoter on an easily curable, low copy number plasmid. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we generated PCR products by using primers with 36- to 50-nt extensions that are homologous to regions adjacent to the gene to be inactivated and template plasmids carrying antibiotic resistance genes that are flanked by FRT (FLP recognition target) sites. By using the respective PCR products, we made 13 different disruptions of chromosomal genes. Mutants of the arcB, cyaA, lacZYA, ompR-envZ, phnR, pstB, pstCA, pstS, pstSCAB-phoU, recA, and torSTRCAD genes or operons were isolated as antibiotic-resistant colonies after the introduction into bacteria carrying a Red expression plasmid of synthetic (PCR-generated) DNA. The resistance genes were then eliminated by using a helper plasmid encoding the FLP recombinase which is also easily curable.
