abstract = {The rheological properties of a cell suspension may play an important role in the flow field generated by populations of swimming micro-organisms (e.g. in bioconvection). In this paper, a swimming micro-organism is modelled as a squirming sphere with prescribed tangential surface velocity, in which the centre of mass of the sphere may be displaced from the geometric centre (bottom-heaviness). Effects of inertia and Brownian motion are neglected, because real micro-organisms swim at very low Reynolds numbers but are too large for Brownian effects to be important. The three-dimensional movement of 64 identical squirmers in a simple shear flow field, contained in a cube with periodic boundary conditions, is dynamically computed, for random initial positions and orientations. The computation utilizes a database of pairwise interactions that has been constructed by the boundary element method. The restriction to pairwise additivity of forces is expected to be justified if the suspension is semi-dilute. The results for non-bottom-heavy squirmers show that the squirming does not have a direct influence on the apparent viscosity. However, it does change the probability density in configuration space, and thereby causes a slight decrease in the apparent viscosity at O(c2), where c is the volume fraction of spheres. In the case of bottom-heavy squirmers, on the other hand, the stresslet generated by the squirming motion directly contributes to the bulk stress at O(c), and the suspension shows strong non-Newtonian properties. When the background simple shear flow is directed vertically, the apparent viscosity of the semi-dilute suspension of bottom-heavy squirmers becomes smaller than that of inert spheres. When the shear flow is horizontal and varies with the vertical coordinate, on the other hand, the apparent viscosity becomes larger than that of inert spheres. In addition, significant normal stress differences appear for all relative orientations of gravity and the shear flow, in the case of bottom-heavy squirmers. {\textcopyright} 2007 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {Suspensions of self-propelled particles, such as swimming micro-organisms, are known to undergo complex dynamics as a result of hydrodynamic interactions. To elucidate these dynamics, a kinetic theory is developed and applied to study the linear stability and the nonlinear pattern formation in these systems. The evolution of a suspension of self-propelled particles is modeled using a conservation equation for the particle configurations, coupled to a mean-field description of the flow arising from the stress exerted by the particles on the fluid. Based on this model, we first investigate the stability of both aligned and isotropic suspensions. In aligned suspensions, an instability is shown to always occur at finite wavelengths, a result that extends previous predictions by Simha and Ramaswamy ["Hydrodynamic fluctuations and instabilities in ordered suspensions of self-propelled particles," Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 058101 (2002)]. In isotropic suspensions, we demonstrate the existence of an instability for the active particle stress, in which shear stresses are eigenmodes and grow exponentially at long scales. Nonlinear effects are also investigated using numerical simulations in two dimensions. These simulations confirm the results of the stability analysis, and the long-time nonlinear behavior is shown to be characterized by the formation of strong density fluctuations, which merge and breakup in time in a quasiperiodic fashion. These complex motions result in very efficient fluid mixing, which we quantify by means of a multiscale mixing norm. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

If interparticle hydrodynamic interactions are neglected, the configuration of the suspension is characterized by the particle orientation distribution, which satisfies a Fokker-Planck equation including the effects of the external shear flow, rotary diffusion, and particle tumbling. The orientation distribution then determines the leading-order term in the particle extra stress in the suspension, which can be evaluated based on the classic theory of Hinch and Leal (J Fluid Mech 52(4):683-712, 1972), and involves an additional contribution arising from the permanent force dipole exerted by the particles as they propel themselves through the fluid. Numerical solutions of the steady-state Fokker-Planck equation were obtained using a spectral method, and results are reported for the shear viscosity and normal stress difference coefficients in terms of flow strength, rotary diffusivity, and correlation time for tumbling. It is found that the rheology is characterized by much stronger normal stress differences than for passive suspensions, and that tail-actuated swimmers result in a strong decrease in the effective shear viscosity of the fluid. {\textcopyright} 2009 Society for Experimental Mechanics.},

In agreement with experiments on suspensions of Bacillus subtilis, we show that the viscosity reduction is related to the onset of large-scale collective motion due to interactions between the swimmers. The simulations reveal that the viscosity reduction occurs only for relatively low concentrations of swimmers: Further increases of the concentration yield an increase of the viscosity.

If the shear flow is subjected to small fluctuations produced by small irregularities in the microchannel or by other swimmers nearby, the director dynamics becomes stochastic. Numerical integration of the swimmer motion shows that there is stochastic resonance: The displacement in the vorticity direction is maximized for a finite noise intensity. This transverse displacement resonance is observed when the displacement is coarse grained over several periods, although the director is preferentially oriented along the flow. The resonant noise intensity is proportional to the oscillation frequency and independent of the shear rate. The enhanced displacement can have effects on the transverse diffusion of swimmers and the rheology of the suspension. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Bacterial suspensions—a premier example of active fluids—show an unusual response to shear stresses. Instead of increasing the viscosity of the suspending fluid, the emergent collective motions of swimming bacteria can turn a suspension into a superfluid with zero apparent viscosity. Although the existence of active superfluids has been demonstrated in bulk rheological measurements, the microscopic origin and dynamics of such an exotic phase have not been experimentally probed. Here, using high-speed confocal rheometry, we study the dynamics of concentrated bacterial suspensions under simple planar shear. We find that bacterial superfluids under shear exhibit unusual symmetric shear bands, defying the conventional wisdom on shear banding of complex fluids, where the formation of steady shear bands necessarily breaks the symmetry of unsheared samples. We propose a simple hydrodynamic model based on the local stress balance and the ergodic sampling of nonequilibrium shear configurations, which quantitatively describes the observed symmetric shear-banding structure. The model also successfully predicts various interesting features of swarming vortices in stationary bacterial suspensions. Our study provides insights into the physical properties of collective swarming in active fluids and illustrates their profound influences on transport processes.},

We use a continuum kinetic model to describe the configuration of the particles in the system, in which the disturbance flows induced by the swimmers are taken into account, and use it to calculate estimates of the suspension viscosity for a range of channel widths and flow strengths typical of microfluidic experiments. Our results are in agreement with previous bulk models, and in particular, demonstrate that the effect of activity is strongest at low flow rates, where pushers tend to decrease the suspension viscosity whereas pullers enhance it. In stronger flows, dissipative stresses overcome the effects of activity leading to increased viscosities followed by shear-thinning. The effects of confinement and number density are also analyzed, and our results confirm the apparent transition to superfluidity reported in recent experiments on pusher suspensions at intermediate densities. We also derive an approximate analytical expression for the effective viscosity in the limit of weak flows and wide channels, and demonstrate good agreement between theory and numerical calculations.},

As a paradigmatic model of active fluids, bacterial suspensions show intriguing rheological responses drastically different from their counterpart colloidal suspensions. Although the flow of bulk bacterial suspensions has been extensively studied, the rheology of bacterial suspensions under confinement has not been experimentally explored. Here, using a microfluidic viscometer, we systematically measure the rheology of dilute Escherichia coli suspensions under different degrees of confinement. Our study reveals a strong confinement effect: the viscosity of bacterial suspensions decreases substantially when the confinement scale is comparable or smaller than the run length of bacteria. Moreover, we also investigate the microscopic dynamics of bacterial suspensions including velocity profiles, bacterial density distributions, and single bacterial dynamics in shear flows. These measurements allow us to construct a simple heuristic model based on the boundary layer of upstream swimming bacteria near confining walls, which qualitatively explains our experimental observations. Our study sheds light on the influence of the boundary layer of collective bacterial motions on the flow of confined bacterial suspensions. Our results provide a benchmark for testing different rheological models of active fluids and are useful for understanding the transport of microorganisms in confined geometries.},

@article{Bricard2013,
abstract = {From the formation of animal flocks to the emergence of coordinated motion in bacterial swarms, populations of motile organisms at all scales display coherent collective motion. This consistent behaviour strongly contrasts with the difference in communication abilities between the individuals. On the basis of this universal feature, it has been proposed that alignment rules at the individual level could solely account for the emergence of unidirectional motion at the group level. This hypothesis has been supported by agent-based simulations. However, more complex collective behaviours have been systematically found in experiments, including the formation of vortices, fluctuating swarms, clustering and swirling. All these (living and man-made) model systems (bacteria, biofilaments and molecular motors, shaken grains and reactive colloids) predominantly rely on actual collisions to generate collective motion. As a result, the potential local alignment rules are entangled with more complex, and often unknown, interactions. The large-scale behaviour of the populations therefore strongly depends on these uncontrolled microscopic couplings, which are extremely challenging to measure and describe theoretically. Here we report that dilute populations of millions of colloidal rolling particles self-organize to achieve coherent motion in a unique direction, with very few density and velocity fluctuations. Quantitatively identifying the microscopic interactions between the rollers allows a theoretical description of this polar-liquid state. Comparison of the theory with experiment suggests that hydrodynamic interactions promote the emergence of collective motion either in the form of a single macroscopic 'flock', at low densities, or in that of a homogenous polar phase, at higher densities. Furthermore, hydrodynamics protects the polar-liquid state from the giant density fluctuations that were hitherto considered the hallmark of populations of self-propelled particles. Our experiments demonstrate that genuine physical interactions at the individual level are sufficient to set homogeneous active populations into stable directed motion. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

Through their self-motion, all active matter systems generate a unique swim pressure that is entirely athermal in origin. The origin of the swim pressure is based upon the notion that an active body would swim away in space unless confined by boundaries - this confinement pressure is precisely the swim pressure. Here we give the micromechanical basis for the swim stress and use this new perspective to study self-assembly and phase separation in active soft matter. The swim pressure gives rise to a nonequilibrium equation of state for active matter with pressure-volume phase diagrams that resemble a van der Waals loop from equilibrium gas-liquid coexistence. Theoretical predictions are corroborated by Brownian dynamics simulations.

abstract = {We analyze the stress, dispersion, and average swimming speed of self-propelled particles subjected to an external field that affects their orientation and speed. The swimming trajectory is governed by a competition between the orienting influence (i.e., taxis) associated with the external (e.g., magnetic, gravitational, thermal, nutrient concentration) field versus the effects that randomize the particle orientations (e.g., rotary Brownian motion and/or an intrinsic tumbling mechanism like the flagella of bacteria). The swimmers' motion is characterized by a mean drift velocity and an effective translational diffusivity that becomes anisotropic in the presence of the orienting field. Since the diffusivity yields information about the micromechanical stress, the anisotropy generated by the external field creates a normal stress difference in the recently developed "swim stress" tensor [Takatori, Yan, and Brady, Phys. Rev. Lett., 2014]. This property can be exploited in the design of soft, compressible materials in which their size, shape, and motion can be manipulated and tuned by loading the material with active swimmers. Since the swimmers exert different normal stresses in different directions, the material can compress/expand, elongate, and translate depending on the external field strength. Such an active system can be used as nano/micromechanical devices and motors. Analytical solutions are corroborated by Brownian dynamics simulations. This journal is},

abstract = {The immense diversity of microbial life found in the vadose zone reflects the extremely heterogeneous and highly dynamic aquatic and chemical environments formed within soil pore spaces. The notion of planktonian free swimming microbes is unrealistic under most unsaturated conditions. Experimental and theoretical evidence suggests that surface attachment is the prevailing lifestyle, where bacterial colonies are embedded in biosynthesized extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). This strategy represents a successful adaptation to the variable and unpredictable hydration conditions near the earth surface. The EPS matrix serves as the interface with the environment; it enhances hydration and transport properties in the immediate vicinity of microbial cells, and dampens effects of highly transient fluctuations in water and nutrient fluxes. The primary effect of soil pore geometry and hydration status is on diffusion pathways to and away from stationary microbial colonies. Microbial dependency on diffusion processes occurs at all scales, but is particularly important at the colony scale. We illustrate the critical role of diffusion pathways with their complex spatial and temporal patterns in promoting coexistence and diversity. We review specific features and adaptations of microbial life to the particular conditions of terrestrial soil environments. The physical and related chemical conditions that shape microbial habitats and govern key processes in unsaturated soils are reviewed in a quantitative framework. Key physiological adaptations and biological responses to challenges presented by unsaturated conditions are discussed. Finally, we discuss potential impacts of microbial activity on properties and characteristics of the host porous medium. This review is an attempt to establish an interdisciplinary dialogue between hydrologists and microbiologists towards a quantitative integration of the role of hydrologic conditions on microbial activity and the role of microbiology in controlling macroscopic fluxes within this important compartment of the biosphere. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This review compiles and analyses the taxonomic and biogeographical information available on soil ciliates. Key literature (257 references) is tabulated for each species. Furthermore, about 500 new records are reported from hundreds of samples collected world-wide, and four new species are described from Kenyan soils, including the new genus Apobryophyllum; Metopus ovalis Kahl, 1927 is redescribed. 643 ciliate species were originally described or reliably recorded from about 1000 soil samples world-wide, 49 (7.6{\%}) of them were later recognized as junior synonyms, and 78 (13.2{\%}) have been poorly described, leaving a total of 516 well-known species. However, the studied samples contained about 700 new species, most of which (about 500) have not yet been described. Thus, the total number of soil ciliates amounts to at least 1000 species. The overwhelming portion of soil ciliates belongs to three systematic assemblages, viz. the hypotrichs (39{\%}), gymnostomatids (26{\%}) and colpodids (13{\%}) if the undescribed species are taken into account. Most soil ciliates feed on bacteria (39{\%}) or are predatory (34{\%}) or omnivorous (20{\%}). Some are strictly mycophagous and highly characteristic for terrestrial habitats; and a few (mainly metopids) are anaerobic. Only about one fourth of the soil ciliate species has been reliably reported from freshwater habitats and from more than three out of five main biogeographical regions, indicating a high specificity of the soil ciliate biota and a limited distribution of at least some species. This is supported by the observation that some very conspicuous species, such as Krassniggia auxiliaris and Bresslauides discoideus, have so far been found only in Gondwanan, respectively, Laurasian soils.},

It is shown that, in addition to Einstein's like contribution to the effective viscosity, that is proportional to the volume fraction of the swimmers, a contribution due to the activity of self-propelled particles influences the viscosity. As a result of the activity of swimmers, the effective viscosity would be lower (higher) than the viscosity of the suspending medium when the particles are pusher (puller).

abstract = {A complex fluid submitted to strong flows can endure irreversible changes in its structure. This is the case for long chain polymer additives that are commonly used as viscosity enhancers in industry, notably for oil recovery. These polymers break in solution when submitted to high deformation rates, eventually causing a serious viscosity loss. This problem of practical importance is though difficult to handle from a fundamental point of view given its complexity. We introduce here a new tool, based on microfluidic technology, for the screening of the degradation of solutions in the model situation of the flow through a constriction. We integrate two functions in a single set-up, a micro-fabricated constriction and an on-chip viscosimeter. This tool enables us to probe rapidly the viscosity loss imparted by flowing through the constriction at a given flow rate. Thanks to microfluidics, the sample preparation and measurement time are significantly lower than those implied by classical measurement protocols (reduction by up to two orders of magnitude). In addition, confinement provides control of the flow in terms of inertia. To illustrate the potential of this approach in a screening perspective, we use this tool to study the degradation of a series of semi-dilute aqueous solutions of PEO of varying molecular weights and concentrations. For each solution we identify a threshold flow rate for polymer degradation. The corresponding critical deformation rate decreases with molecular weight and concentration, as expected (the mass dependence is in line with previous reports and theories for dilute solutions). In addition we characterize the viscosity loss for larger deformation rates and find that, despite the polydispersity of our solutions, the observations for the various solutions can be roughly recast on a master curve by renormalization of the imposed deformation rates according to a law Mw- 1.7 ± 03 c- 0.7 ± 03. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The motility of organisms is often directed in response to environmental stimuli. Rheotaxis is the directed movement resulting from fluid velocity gradients, long studied in fish, aquatic invertebrates, and spermatozoa. Using carefully controlled microfluidic flows, we show that rheotaxis also occurs in bacteria. Excellent quantitative agreement between experiments with Bacillus subtilis and a mathematical model reveals that bacterial rheotaxis is a purely physical phenomenon, in contrast to fish rheotaxis but in the same way as sperm rheotaxis. This previously unrecognized bacterial taxis results from a subtle interplay between velocity gradients and the helical shape of flagella, which together generate a torque that alters a bacterium's swimming direction. Because this torque is independent of the presence of a nearby surface, bacterial rheotaxis is not limited to the immediate neighborhood of liquid-solid interfaces, but also takes place in the bulk fluid. We predict that rheotaxis occurs in a wide range of bacterial habitats, from the natural environment to the human body, and can interfere with chemotaxis, suggesting that the fitness benefit conferred by bacterial motility may be sharply reduced in some hydrodynamic conditions.},

abstract = {Bacteria often live in dynamic fluid environments and flow can affect fundamental microbial processes such as nutrient uptake and infection. However, little is known about the consequences of the forces and torques associated with fluid flow on bacteria. Through microfluidic experiments, we show that fluid shear produces strong spatial heterogeneity in suspensions of motile bacteria, characterized by up to 70{\%} cell depletion from low-shear regions due to 'trapping' in high-shear regions. Two mathematical models and a scaling analysis accurately capture these observations, including the maximal depletion at mean shear rates of 2.5-10 s -1, and reveal that trapping by shear originates from the competition between the cell alignment with the flow and the stochasticity in the swimming orientation. We show that this shear-induced trapping directly impacts widespread bacterial behaviours, by hampering chemotaxis and promoting surface attachment. These results suggest that the hydrodynamic environment may directly affect bacterial fitness and should be carefully considered in the study of microbial processes. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

We deduce that individual bacteria entering a flow system can rapidly migrate upstream ({\textgreater}20 $\mu$m/s) much faster than a gradually advancing biofilm. Given a bacterial population with a distribution of sizes and swim speeds, local shear rate near the surface determines the dominant hydrodynamic mode for motility, i.e., circular or random trajectories for low shear rates, positive rheotaxis for moderate flow, and sideways swimming at higher shear rates. Faster swimmers can move upstream more rapidly and at higher shear rates, as expected.

Here, we use computer simulations of dilute populations for a simplified model of an organism to calculate the dynamics of swimmers between two walls with an external fluid flow. Simulations with and without hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) are used to quantify their influence on surface accumulation. We found that the accumulation of organisms at the wall is larger when HIs are included. An external fluid flow orients the organisms parallel to the fluid flow, which reduces the accumulation at the walls. The effect of the flow on the orientations is quantified and compared to previous work on upstream swimming of organisms and alignment of passive rods in flow. In pressure-driven flow, the zero shear rate at the channel center leads to a dip in the concentration of organisms in the center. The curvature of this dip is quantified as a function of the flow rate. The fluid flow also affects the transport of organisms across the channel from one wall to the other. {\textcopyright} 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Confined suspensions of active particles show peculiar dynamics characterized by wall accumulation, as well as upstream swimming, centreline depletion and shear trapping when a pressure-driven flow is imposed. We use theory and numerical simulations to investigate the effects of confinement and non-uniform shear on the dynamics of a dilute suspension of Brownian active swimmers by incorporating a detailed treatment of boundary conditions within a simple kinetic model where the configuration of the suspension is described using a conservation equation for the probability distribution function of particle positions and orientations, and where particle–particle and particle–wall hydrodynamic interactions are neglected. Based on this model, we first investigate the effects of confinement in the absence of flow, in which case the dynamics is governed by a swimming P{\'{e}}clet number, or ratio of the persistence length of particle trajectories over the channel width, and a second swimmer-specific parameter whose inverse measures the strength of propulsion. In the limit of weak and strong propulsion, asymptotic expressions for the full distribution function are derived. For finite propulsion, analytical expressions for the concentration and polarization profiles are also obtained using a truncated moment expansion of the distribution function. In agreement with experimental observations, the existence of a concentration/polarization boundary layer in wide channels is reported and characterized, suggesting that wall accumulation in active suspensions is primarily a kinematic effect that does not require hydrodynamic interactions. Next, we show that application of a pressure-driven Poiseuille flow leads to net upstream swimming of the particles relative to the flow, and an analytical expression for the mean upstream velocity is derived in the weak-flow limit. In stronger imposed flows, we also predict the formation of a depletion layer near the channel centreline, due to cross-streamline migration of the swimming particles towards high-shear regions where they become trapped, and an asymptotic analysis in the strong-flow limit is used to obtain a scale for the depletion layer thickness and to rationalize the non-monotonic dependence of the intensity of depletion upon flow rate. Our theoretical predictions are all shown to be in excellent agreement with finite-volume numerical simulations of the kinetic model, and are also supported by recent experiments on bacterial suspensions in microfluidic devices.},

abstract = {Cells swimming in confined environments are attracted by surfaces. We measure the steady-state distribution of smooth-swimming bacteria (Escherichia coli) between two glass plates. In agreement with earlier studies, we find a strong increase of the cell concentration at the boundaries. We demonstrate theoretically that hydrodynamic interactions of the swimming cells with solid surfaces lead to their reorientation in the direction parallel to the surfaces, as well as their attraction by the closest wall. A model is derived for the steady-state distribution of swimming cells, which compares favorably with our measurements. We exploit our data to estimate the flagellar propulsive force in swimming E.coli. {\textcopyright} 2008 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {In this Letter we propose a kinematic model to explain how collisions with a surface and rotational Brownian motion give rise to accumulation of microswimmers near a surface. In this model, an elongated microswimmer invariably travels parallel to the surface after hitting it from an oblique angle. It then swims away from the surface, facilitated by rotational Brownian motion. Simulations based on this model reproduce the density distributions measured for the small bacteria E. coli and Caulobacter crescentus, as well as for the much larger bull spermatozoa swimming between two walls. {\textcopyright} 2009 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Blake1971,
abstract = {The velocity and pressure fields for Stokes's flow due to a point force (‘stokeslet') in the vicinity of a stationary plane boundary are analysed, using Fourier transforms, to obtain the image system required to satisfy the no-slip condition on the boundary. The image system, which is illustrated by diagrams, is found to consist of a stokeslet equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the initial stokeslet, a stokes-doublet and a source-doublet, the displacement axes for the doublets being in the original direction of the force. The influence of the wall on the near and far fields is discussed. In the far field it is found that a stokeslet aligned parallel to the wall produces a stokes-doublet far-field, whereas a stokeslet normal to the wall produces a combination of a source-doublet and a stokes-quadrupole far-field. Although results can be alternatively derived by the method of Lorentz (7) using a reciprocal theorem, the present method yields much more clearly the form of the image system. {\textcopyright} 1971, Cambridge Philosophical Society.

@article{Mathijssen2016,
abstract = {One of the principal mechanisms by which surfaces and interfaces affect microbial life is by perturbing the hydrodynamic flows generated by swimming. By summing a recursive series of image systems, we derive a numerically tractable approximation to the three-dimensional flow fields of a stokeslet (point force) within a viscous film between a parallel no-slip surface and a no-shear interface and, from this Green's function, we compute the flows produced by a force-and torque-free micro-swimmer. We also extend the exact solution of Liron {\&} Mochon (J. Engng Maths, vol. 10 (4), 1976, pp. 287-303) to the film geometry, which demonstrates that the image series gives a satisfactory approximation to the swimmer flow fields if the film is sufficiently thick compared to the swimmer size, and we derive the swimmer flows in the thin-film limit. Concentrating on the thick-film case, we find that the dipole moment induces a bias towards swimmer accumulation at the no-slip wall rather than the water-air interface, but that higher-order multipole moments can oppose this. Based on the analytic predictions, we propose an experimental method to find the multipole coefficient that induces circular swimming trajectories, allowing one to analytically determine the swimmer's three-dimensional position under a microscope.},

@article{Parkinson1978,
abstract = {Motile, but generally nonchemotactic (che) mutants of E. coli were examined for complementation and recombination with specialized $\lambda$fla transducing phages. The complex complementation behavior of these mutants found previously in F-prime tests could largely be accounted for by intragenic complementation and by polarity effects. Mutants of the 'cheA' class defined two genes, cheA and cheW, which appeared to be cotranscribed. Mutants of the 'cheB' class defined four genes, cheX, cheB, cheY, and cheZ, which also constituted a transcriptional unit. Mutants defective in cheA, cheW, cheX, or cheY function swam smoothly, with little or no tumbling, whereas cheB or cheZ mutants exhibited very high tumbling rates. These functions are probably involved in initiating or controlling changes in flagellar rotation in response to chemotactic stimuli.},
