We find that the sound velocity is anisotropic and characterized by its speed c for propagation perpendicular to the mean velocity ⟨$\upsilon$→⟩, ⟨$\upsilon$→⟩ itself, and a third velocity $\lambda$⟨$\upsilon$→⟩, arising explicitly from the lack of Galilean invariance in flocks. {\textcopyright} 1998 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {We present a quantitative continuum theory of “flocking”: the collective coherent motion of large numbers of self-propelled organisms. In agreement with everyday experience, our model predicts the existence of an “ordered phase” of flocks, in which all members of even an arbitrarily large flock move together with the same mean velocity [formula presented] This coherent motion of the flock is an example of spontaneously broken symmetry: no preferred direction for the motion is picked out a priori in the model; rather, each flock is allowed to, and does, spontaneously pick out some completely arbitrary direction to move in. By analyzing our model we can make detailed, quantitative predictions for the long-distance, long-time behavior of this “broken symmetry state.” The “Goldstone modes” associated with this “spontaneously broken rotational symmetry” are fluctuations in the direction of motion of a large part of the flock away from the mean direction of motion of the flock as a whole. These “Goldstone modes” mix with modes associated with conservation of bird number to produce propagating sound modes. These sound modes lead to enormous fluctuations of the density of the flock, far larger, at long wavelengths, than those in, e.g., an equilibrium gas. Our model is similar in many ways to the Navier-Stokes equations for a simple compressible fluid; in other ways, it resembles a relaxational time-dependent Ginsburg-Landau theory for an [formula presented] component isotropic ferromagnet. In spatial dimensions [formula presented] the long-distance behavior is correctly described by a linearized theory, and is equivalent to that of an unusual but nonetheless equilibrium model for spin systems. For [formula presented] nonlinear fluctuation effects radically alter the long distance behavior, making it different from that of any known equilibrium model. In particular, we find that in [formula presented] where we can calculate the scaling exponents exactly, flocks exhibit a true, long-range ordered, spontaneously broken symmetry state, in contrast to equilibrium systems, which cannot spontaneously break a continuous symmetry in [formula presented] (the “Mermin-Wagner” theorem). We make detailed predictions for various correlation functions that could be measured either in simulations, or by quantitative imaging of real flocks. We also consider an anisotropic model, in which the birds move preferentially in an “easy” (e.g., horizontal) plane, and make analogous, but quantitatively different, predictions for that model as well. For this anisotropic model, we obtain exact scaling exponents for all spatial dimensions, including the physically relevant case [formula presented] {\textcopyright} 1998 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Suspensions of self-propelled particles, such as swimming micro-organisms, are known to undergo complex dynamics as a result of hydrodynamic interactions. To elucidate these dynamics, a kinetic theory is developed and applied to study the linear stability and the nonlinear pattern formation in these systems. The evolution of a suspension of self-propelled particles is modeled using a conservation equation for the particle configurations, coupled to a mean-field description of the flow arising from the stress exerted by the particles on the fluid. Based on this model, we first investigate the stability of both aligned and isotropic suspensions. In aligned suspensions, an instability is shown to always occur at finite wavelengths, a result that extends previous predictions by Simha and Ramaswamy ["Hydrodynamic fluctuations and instabilities in ordered suspensions of self-propelled particles," Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 058101 (2002)]. In isotropic suspensions, we demonstrate the existence of an instability for the active particle stress, in which shear stresses are eigenmodes and grow exponentially at long scales. Nonlinear effects are also investigated using numerical simulations in two dimensions. These simulations confirm the results of the stability analysis, and the long-time nonlinear behavior is shown to be characterized by the formation of strong density fluctuations, which merge and breakup in time in a quasiperiodic fashion. These complex motions result in very efficient fluid mixing, which we quantify by means of a multiscale mixing norm. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Numerical models indicate that collective animal behavior may emerge from simple local rules of interaction among the individuals. However, very little is known about the nature of such interaction, so that models and theories mostly rely on aprioristic assumptions. By reconstructing the three-dimensional positions of individual birds in airborne flocks of a few thousand members, we show that the interaction does not depend on the metric distance, as most current models and theories assume, but rather on the topological distance. In fact, we discovered that each bird interacts on average with a fixed number of neighbors (six to seven), rather than with all neighbors within a fixed metric distance. We argue that a topological interaction is indispensable to maintain a flock's cohesion against the large density changes caused by external perturbations, typically predation. We support this hypothesis by numerical simulations, showing that a topological interaction grants significantly higher cohesion of the aggregation compared with a standard metric one. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Despite the growing interest in collective phenomena such as "swarm intelligence" and "wisdom of the crowds," little is known about the mechanisms underlying decision-making in vertebrate animal groups. How do animals use the behavior of others to make more accurate decisions, especially when it is not possible to identify which individuals possess pertinent information? One plausible answer is that individuals respond only when they see a threshold number of individuals perform a particular behavior. Here, we investigate the role of such "quorum responses" in the movement decisions of fish (three-spine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus). We show that a quorum response to conspecifics can explain how sticklebacks make collective movement decisions, both in the absence and presence of a potential predation risk. Importantly our experimental work shows that a quorum response can reduce the likelihood of amplification of nonadaptive following behavior. Whereas the traveling direction of solitary fish was strongly influenced by a single replica conspecific, the replica was largely ignored by larger groups of four or eight sticklebacks under risk, and the addition of a second replica was required to exert influence on the movement decisions of such groups. Model simulations further predict that quorum responses by fish improve the accuracy and speed of their decision-making over that of independent decision-makers or those using a weak linear response. This study shows that effective and accurate information transfer in groups may be gained only through nonlinear responses of group members to each other, thus highlighting the importance of quorum decision-making. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

The bacteria spontaneously form closely packed dynamic clusters within which they move cooperatively. The number of bacteria in a cluster exhibits a power-law distribution truncated by an exponential tail. The probability of finding clusters with large numbers of bacteria grows markedly as the bacterial density increases. The number of bacteria per unit area exhibits fluctuations far larger than those for populations in thermal equilibrium. Such "giant number fluctuations" have been found in models and in experiments on inert systems but not observed previously in a biological system.

abstract = {The emergence of coherent structures, large-scale flows and correlated dynamics in suspensions of motile particles such as swimming micro-organisms or artificial microswimmers is studied using direct particle simulations. A detailed model is proposed for a slender rod-like particle that propels itself in a viscous fluid by exerting a prescribed tangential stress on its surface, and a method is devised for the efficient calculation of hydrodynamic interactions in large-scale suspensions of such particles using slender-body theory and a smooth particle-mesh Ewald algorithm. Simulations are performed with periodic boundary conditions for various system sizes and suspension volume fractions, and demonstrate a transition to large-scale correlated motions in suspensions of rear-actuated swimmers, or Pushers, above a critical volume fraction or system size. This transition, which is not observed in suspensions of head-actuated swimmers, or Pullers, is seen most clearly in particle velocity and passive tracer statistics. These observations are consistent with predictions from our previous mean-field kinetic theory, one of which states that instabilities will arise in uniform isotropic suspensions of Pushers when the product of the linear system size with the suspension volume fraction exceeds a given threshold. We also find that the collective dynamics of Pushers result in giant number fluctuations, local alignment of swimmers and strongly mixing flows. Suspensions of Pullers, which evince no large-scale dynamics, nonetheless display interesting deviations from the random isotropic state. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Ensembles of collectively moving particles like flocks of birds, bacteria, or filamentous polymers show a broad range of intriguing phenomena, yet seem to obey very similar physical principles. These generic principles have been predicted to lead to characteristic density fluctuations, which are in sharp contrast to normal fluctuations determining the properties of ordered systems in thermal equilibrium. Using high-density motility assays of driven filaments, we characterize here the origin and nature of giant fluctuations that emerge in this class of systems. By showing that these unique statistical properties result from the coupling between particle density and the topology of the velocity field of the particles, we provide insight in the physics of collective motion.},
annote = {3D system

Key results:
- Coupling between density and topology of velocity, especially the delay of density changes responding to the velocity field defects
- Show emergence of GNF. When there is no velocity defect, dN scalse with N{\^{}}0.5.
- directional fluctuations are anisotropic, higher correlation length along transversal direction
- anisotropy stems from the large aspect ratio of filaments
- dN scales with N, the largest number fluctuation, results from macroscopic phase separation.

abstract = {We show that dry active nematics, e.g., collections of shaken elongated granular particles, exhibit large-scale spatiotemporal chaos made of interacting dense, ordered, bandlike structures in a parameter region including the linear onset of nematic order. These results are obtained from the study of both the well-known (deterministic) hydrodynamic equations describing these systems and of the self-propelled particle model they were derived from. We prove, in particular, that the chaos stems from the generic instability of the band solution of the hydrodynamic equations. Revisiting the status of the strong fluctuations and long-range correlations in the particle model, we show that the giant number fluctuations observed in the chaotic phase are a trivial consequence of density segregation. However anomalous, curvature-driven number fluctuations are present in the homogeneous quasiordered nematic phase and characterized by a nontrivial scaling exponent. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Cultured stem cells have become a standard platform not only for regenerative medicine and developmental biology but also for biophysical studies. Yet, the characterization of cultured stem cells at the level of morphology and of the macroscopic patterns resulting from cell-to-cell interactions remains largely qualitative. Here we report on the collective dynamics of cultured murine neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which are multipotent stem cells that give rise to cells in the central nervous system. At low densities, NPCs moved randomly in an amoeba-like fashion. However, NPCs at high density elongated and aligned their shapes with one another, gliding at relatively high velocities. Although the direction of motion of individual cells reversed stochastically along the axes of alignment, the cells were capable of forming an aligned pattern up to length scales similar to that of the migratory stream observed in the adult brain. The two-dimensional order of alignment within the culture showed a liquid-crystalline pattern containing interspersed topological defects with winding numbers of +1/2 and-1/2 (half-integer due to the nematic feature that arises from the head-tail symmetry of cell-to-cell interaction). We identified rapid cell accumulation at +1/2 defects and the formation of three-dimensional mounds. Imaging at the single-cell level around the defects allowed us to quantify the velocity field and the evolving cell density; cells not only concentrate at +1/2 defects, but also escape from-1/2 defects. We propose a generic mechanism for the instability in cell density around the defects that arises from the interplay between the anisotropic friction and the active force field.},

The strong confinement induces weak nematic alignment upon collision, which, for large enough density of cells, gives rise to global nematic order.

Using large-scale simulations of the Vicsek model in two and three dimensions, we find the overall phenomenology and generic algebraic scaling predicted by Toner and Tu, but our data on density correlations reveal some qualitative discrepancies. The values of the associated scaling exponents we estimate differ significantly from those conjectured in 1995. In particular, we identify a large crossover scale beyond which flocks are only weakly anisotropic. We discuss the meaning and consequences of these results.},

@article{Toner2019,
abstract = {It has been shown [H. Chat{\'{e}} et al., Phys. Rev. E 77, 046113 (2008) and F. Ginelli, Eur. Phys. J.: Spec. Top. 225, 2099 (2016)] that the hydrodynamic equations of dry active polar fluids (i.e., moving flocks without momentum conservation) imply giant number fluctuations. Specifically, the rms fluctuations ($\delta$N)2 of the number N of active particles in a region containing a mean number of active particles N scale according to the law ($\delta$N)2=K′N(d) with (d)=710+15d in d ≤ 4 spatial dimensions. This is much larger than the "law of large numbers" scaling ($\delta$N)2=KN found in most equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems. In this paper, it is demonstrated that giant number fluctuations also depend singularly on the shape of the box in which one counts the particles, vanishing in the limit of very thin and very fat boxes. These fluctuations arise not from large density fluctuations - indeed, the density fluctuations in polar ordered dry active fluids are not in general particularly large - but from long ranged spatial correlations between those fluctuations. These are shown to be closely related in two spatial dimensions to the electrostatic potential near a sharp upward pointing conducting wedge of opening angle 3$\pi$4=135° and in three dimensions to the electrostatic potential near a sharp upward pointing charged cone of opening angle 37.16°. This very precise prediction can be stringently tested by alternative box counting experiments that directly measure the direction dependence, as well as the scaling with distance, of the density-density correlation function.},

We utilize the Quincke effect to achieve controlled sequences of repeated particle runs and random reorientations.
