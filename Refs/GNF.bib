abstract = {We present a quantitative continuum theory of “flocking”: the collective coherent motion of large numbers of self-propelled organisms. In agreement with everyday experience, our model predicts the existence of an “ordered phase” of flocks, in which all members of even an arbitrarily large flock move together with the same mean velocity [formula presented] This coherent motion of the flock is an example of spontaneously broken symmetry: no preferred direction for the motion is picked out a priori in the model; rather, each flock is allowed to, and does, spontaneously pick out some completely arbitrary direction to move in. By analyzing our model we can make detailed, quantitative predictions for the long-distance, long-time behavior of this “broken symmetry state.” The “Goldstone modes” associated with this “spontaneously broken rotational symmetry” are fluctuations in the direction of motion of a large part of the flock away from the mean direction of motion of the flock as a whole. These “Goldstone modes” mix with modes associated with conservation of bird number to produce propagating sound modes. These sound modes lead to enormous fluctuations of the density of the flock, far larger, at long wavelengths, than those in, e.g., an equilibrium gas. Our model is similar in many ways to the Navier-Stokes equations for a simple compressible fluid; in other ways, it resembles a relaxational time-dependent Ginsburg-Landau theory for an [formula presented] component isotropic ferromagnet. In spatial dimensions [formula presented] the long-distance behavior is correctly described by a linearized theory, and is equivalent to that of an unusual but nonetheless equilibrium model for spin systems. For [formula presented] nonlinear fluctuation effects radically alter the long distance behavior, making it different from that of any known equilibrium model. In particular, we find that in [formula presented] where we can calculate the scaling exponents exactly, flocks exhibit a true, long-range ordered, spontaneously broken symmetry state, in contrast to equilibrium systems, which cannot spontaneously break a continuous symmetry in [formula presented] (the “Mermin-Wagner” theorem). We make detailed predictions for various correlation functions that could be measured either in simulations, or by quantitative imaging of real flocks. We also consider an anisotropic model, in which the birds move preferentially in an “easy” (e.g., horizontal) plane, and make analogous, but quantitatively different, predictions for that model as well. For this anisotropic model, we obtain exact scaling exponents for all spatial dimensions, including the physically relevant case [formula presented] {\textcopyright} 1998 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Suspensions of self-propelled particles, such as swimming micro-organisms, are known to undergo complex dynamics as a result of hydrodynamic interactions. To elucidate these dynamics, a kinetic theory is developed and applied to study the linear stability and the nonlinear pattern formation in these systems. The evolution of a suspension of self-propelled particles is modeled using a conservation equation for the particle configurations, coupled to a mean-field description of the flow arising from the stress exerted by the particles on the fluid. Based on this model, we first investigate the stability of both aligned and isotropic suspensions. In aligned suspensions, an instability is shown to always occur at finite wavelengths, a result that extends previous predictions by Simha and Ramaswamy ["Hydrodynamic fluctuations and instabilities in ordered suspensions of self-propelled particles," Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 058101 (2002)]. In isotropic suspensions, we demonstrate the existence of an instability for the active particle stress, in which shear stresses are eigenmodes and grow exponentially at long scales. Nonlinear effects are also investigated using numerical simulations in two dimensions. These simulations confirm the results of the stability analysis, and the long-time nonlinear behavior is shown to be characterized by the formation of strong density fluctuations, which merge and breakup in time in a quasiperiodic fashion. These complex motions result in very efficient fluid mixing, which we quantify by means of a multiscale mixing norm. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Numerical models indicate that collective animal behavior may emerge from simple local rules of interaction among the individuals. However, very little is known about the nature of such interaction, so that models and theories mostly rely on aprioristic assumptions. By reconstructing the three-dimensional positions of individual birds in airborne flocks of a few thousand members, we show that the interaction does not depend on the metric distance, as most current models and theories assume, but rather on the topological distance. In fact, we discovered that each bird interacts on average with a fixed number of neighbors (six to seven), rather than with all neighbors within a fixed metric distance. We argue that a topological interaction is indispensable to maintain a flock's cohesion against the large density changes caused by external perturbations, typically predation. We support this hypothesis by numerical simulations, showing that a topological interaction grants significantly higher cohesion of the aggregation compared with a standard metric one. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Despite the growing interest in collective phenomena such as "swarm intelligence" and "wisdom of the crowds," little is known about the mechanisms underlying decision-making in vertebrate animal groups. How do animals use the behavior of others to make more accurate decisions, especially when it is not possible to identify which individuals possess pertinent information? One plausible answer is that individuals respond only when they see a threshold number of individuals perform a particular behavior. Here, we investigate the role of such "quorum responses" in the movement decisions of fish (three-spine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus). We show that a quorum response to conspecifics can explain how sticklebacks make collective movement decisions, both in the absence and presence of a potential predation risk. Importantly our experimental work shows that a quorum response can reduce the likelihood of amplification of nonadaptive following behavior. Whereas the traveling direction of solitary fish was strongly influenced by a single replica conspecific, the replica was largely ignored by larger groups of four or eight sticklebacks under risk, and the addition of a second replica was required to exert influence on the movement decisions of such groups. Model simulations further predict that quorum responses by fish improve the accuracy and speed of their decision-making over that of independent decision-makers or those using a weak linear response. This study shows that effective and accurate information transfer in groups may be gained only through nonlinear responses of group members to each other, thus highlighting the importance of quorum decision-making. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

The bacteria spontaneously form closely packed dynamic clusters within which they move cooperatively. The number of bacteria in a cluster exhibits a power-law distribution truncated by an exponential tail. The probability of finding clusters with large numbers of bacteria grows markedly as the bacterial density increases. The number of bacteria per unit area exhibits fluctuations far larger than those for populations in thermal equilibrium.

In this Letter we study the relationship between giant number fluctuations and structure functions for different models of active matter as well as other nonequilibrium systems. A unified picture emerges, with different models falling in four distinct classes depending on the nature of their structure functions.

abstract = {Ensembles of collectively moving particles like flocks of birds, bacteria, or filamentous polymers show a broad range of intriguing phenomena, yet seem to obey very similar physical principles. These generic principles have been predicted to lead to characteristic density fluctuations, which are in sharp contrast to normal fluctuations determining the properties of ordered systems in thermal equilibrium. Using high-density motility assays of driven filaments, we characterize here the origin and nature of giant fluctuations that emerge in this class of systems. By showing that these unique statistical properties result from the coupling between particle density and the topology of the velocity field of the particles, we provide insight in the physics of collective motion.},

These results are obtained from the study of both the well-known (deterministic) hydrodynamic equations describing these systems and of the self-propelled particle model they were derived from. We prove, in particular, that the chaos stems from the generic instability of the band solution of the hydrodynamic equations. Revisiting the status of the strong fluctuations and long-range correlations in the particle model, we show that the giant number fluctuations observed in the chaotic phase are a trivial consequence of density segregation.

abstract = {Cultured stem cells have become a standard platform not only for regenerative medicine and developmental biology but also for biophysical studies. Yet, the characterization of cultured stem cells at the level of morphology and of the macroscopic patterns resulting from cell-to-cell interactions remains largely qualitative. Here we report on the collective dynamics of cultured murine neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which are multipotent stem cells that give rise to cells in the central nervous system. At low densities, NPCs moved randomly in an amoeba-like fashion. However, NPCs at high density elongated and aligned their shapes with one another, gliding at relatively high velocities. Although the direction of motion of individual cells reversed stochastically along the axes of alignment, the cells were capable of forming an aligned pattern up to length scales similar to that of the migratory stream observed in the adult brain. The two-dimensional order of alignment within the culture showed a liquid-crystalline pattern containing interspersed topological defects with winding numbers of +1/2 and-1/2 (half-integer due to the nematic feature that arises from the head-tail symmetry of cell-to-cell interaction). We identified rapid cell accumulation at +1/2 defects and the formation of three-dimensional mounds. Imaging at the single-cell level around the defects allowed us to quantify the velocity field and the evolving cell density; cells not only concentrate at +1/2 defects, but also escape from-1/2 defects. We propose a generic mechanism for the instability in cell density around the defects that arises from the interplay between the anisotropic friction and the active force field.},

Top. 225, 2099 (2016)] that the hydrodynamic equations of dry active polar fluids (i.e., moving flocks without momentum conservation) imply giant number fluctuations. Specifically, the rms fluctuations ($\delta$N)2 of the number N of active particles in a region containing a mean number of active particles N scale according to the law ($\delta$N)2=K′N(d) with (d)=710+15d in d ≤ 4 spatial dimensions. This is much larger than the "law of large numbers" scaling ($\delta$N)2=KN found in most equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems. In this paper, it is demonstrated that giant number fluctuations also depend singularly on the shape of the box in which one counts the particles, vanishing in the limit of very thin and very fat boxes. These fluctuations arise not from large density fluctuations - indeed, the density fluctuations in polar ordered dry active fluids are not in general particularly large - but from long ranged spatial correlations between those fluctuations. These are shown to be closely related in two spatial dimensions to the electrostatic potential near a sharp upward pointing conducting wedge of opening angle 3$\pi$4=135° and in three dimensions to the electrostatic potential near a sharp upward pointing charged cone of opening angle 37.16°. This very precise prediction can be stringently tested by alternative box counting experiments that directly measure the direction dependence, as well as the scaling with distance, of the density-density correlation function.},

abstract = {The problem of low Reynolds number turbulence in active nematic fluids is theoretically addressed. Using numerical simulations, I demonstrate that an incompressible turbulent flow, in two-dimensional active nematics, consists of an ensemble of vortices whose areas are exponentially distributed within a range of scales. Building on this evidence, I construct a mean-field theory of active turbulence by which several measurable quantities, including the spectral densities and the correlation functions, can be analytically calculated. Because of the profound connection between the flow geometry and the topological properties of the nematic director, the theory sheds light on the mechanisms leading to the proliferation of topological defects in active nematics and provides a number of testable predictions. A hypothesis, inspired by Onsager's statistical hydrodynamics, is finally introduced to account for the equilibrium probability distribution of the vortex sizes.},

abstract = {Active matter exhibits various forms of nonequilibrium states in the absence of external forcing, including macroscopic steady-state currents. Such states are often too complex to be modeled from first principles, and our understanding of their physics relies heavily on minimal models. These are mostly studied in the case of "dry"active matter, where particle dynamics are dominated by friction with their surroundings. Significantly less is known about systems with long-range hydrodynamic interactions that belong to "wet"active matter. Dilute suspensions of motile bacteria, modeled as self-propelled dipolar particles interacting solely through long-ranged hydrodynamic fields, are arguably the most studied example from this class of active systems. Their phenomenology is well established: At a sufficiently high density of bacteria, there appear large-scale vortices and jets comprising many individual organisms, forming a chaotic state commonly known as bacterial turbulence. As revealed by computer simulations, below the onset of collective motion, the suspension exhibits very strong correlations between individual microswimmers stemming from the long-ranged nature of dipolar fields. Here, we demonstrate that this phenomenology is captured by the minimal model of microswimmers. We develop a kinetic theory that goes beyond the commonly used mean-field assumption and explicitly takes into account such correlations. Notably, these can be computed exactly within our theory. We calculate the fluid velocity variance, spatial and temporal correlation functions, the fluid velocity spectrum, and the enhanced diffusivity of tracer particles. We find that correlations are suppressed by particle self-propulsion, although the mean-field behavior is not restored even in the limit of very fast swimming. Our theory is not perturbative and is valid for any value of the microswimmer density below the onset of collective motion. This work constitutes a significant methodological advance and allows us to make qualitative and quantitative predictions that can be directly compared to experiments and computer simulations of microswimmer suspensions.},

abstract = {Microbiology is the science of microbes, particularly bacteria. Many bacteria are motile: they are capable of self-propulsion. Among these, a significant class execute so-called run-and-tumble motion: they follow a fairly straight path for a certain distance, then abruptly change direction before repeating the process. This dynamics has something in common with Brownian motion (it is diffusive at large scales), and also something in contrast. Specifically, motility parameters such as the run speed and tumble rate depend on the local environment and hence can vary in space. When they do so, even if a steady state is reached, this is not generally invariant under time reversal: the principle of detailed balance, which restores the microscopic time-reversal symmetry of systems in thermal equilibrium, is mesoscopically absent in motile bacteria. This lack of detailed balance (allowed by the flux of chemical energy that drives motility) creates pitfalls for the unwary modeller. Here I review some statistical–mechanical models for bacterial motility, presenting them as a paradigm for exploring diffusion without detailed balance. I also discuss the extent to which statistical physics is useful in understanding real or potential microbiological experiments.},

abstract = {The postulational basis of classical thermodynamics has been expanded to incorporate equilibrium fluctuations. The main additional elements of the proposed thermodynamic theory are the concept of quasi-equilibrium states, a definition of non-equilibrium entropy, a fundamental equation of state in the entropy representation, and a fluctuation postulate describing the probability distribution of macroscopic parameters of an isolated system. Although these elements introduce a statistical component that does not exist in classical thermodynamics, the logical structure of the theory is different from that of statistical mechanics and represents an expanded version of thermodynamics. Based on this theory, we present a regular procedure for calculations of equilibrium fluctuations of extensive parameters, intensive parameters and densities in systems with any number of fluctuating parameters. The proposed fluctuation formalism is demonstrated by four applications: (1) derivation of the complete set of fluctuation relations for a simple fluid in three different ensembles; (2) fluctuations in finite-reservoir systems interpolating between the canonical and micro-canonical ensembles; (3) derivation of fluctuation relations for excess properties of grain boundaries in binary solid solutions, and (4) derivation of the grain boundary width distribution for pre-melted grain boundaries in alloys. The last two applications offer an efficient fluctuation-based approach to calculations of interface excess properties and extraction of the disjoining potential in pre-melted grain boundaries. Possible future extensions of the theory are outlined.},

abstract = {A landmark of turbulence is the emergence of universal scaling laws, such as Kolmogorov's E(q) {\~{}} q−5∕3 scaling of the kinetic energy spectrum of inertial turbulence with the wavevector q. In recent years, active fluids have been shown to exhibit turbulent-like flows at low Reynolds number. However, the existence of universal scaling properties in these flows has remained unclear. To address this issue, here we propose a minimal defect-free hydrodynamic theory for two-dimensional active nematic fluids at vanishing Reynolds number. By means of large-scale simulations and analytical arguments, we show that the kinetic energy spectrum exhibits a universal scaling E(q) {\~{}} q−1 at long wavelengths. We find that the energy injection due to activity has a peak at a characteristic length scale, which is selected by a nonlinear mechanism. In contrast to inertial turbulence, energy is entirely dissipated at the scale where it is injected, thus precluding energy cascades. Nevertheless, the non-local character of the Stokes flow establishes long-range velocity correlations, which lead to the scaling behaviour. We conclude that active nematic fluids define a distinct universality class of turbulence at low Reynolds number.},

While transport phenomena in a suspension have been studied extensively, how energy is transported from the individual cell scale to the larger mesoscale remains unclear. In this study, we carry out the first successful measurement of the three-dimensional velocity field in a dense suspension of bacteria. The results show that most of the energy generated by individual bacteria dissipates on the cellular scale. Only a small amount of energy is transported to the mesoscale, but the gain in swimming velocity and mass transport due to mesoscale coherent structures is enormous. These results indicate that collective swimming of bacteria is efficient in terms of energy. This paper sheds light on how energy can be transported toward smaller wave numbers in the Stokes flow regime. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Turbulence is ubiquitous, from oceanic currents to small-scale biological and quantum systems. Self-sustained turbulent motion in microbial suspensions presents an intriguing example of collective dynamical behavior among the simplest forms of life and is important for fluid mixing and molecular transport on the microscale. The mathematical characterization of turbulence phenomena in active nonequilibrium fluids proves even more difficult than for conventional liquids or gases. It is not known which features of turbulent phases in living matter are universal or system-specific or which generalizations of the Navier-Stokes equations are able to describe them adequately. Here, we combine experiments, particle simulations, and continuum theory to identify the statistical properties of self-sustained meso-scale turbulence in active systems. To study how dimensionality and boundary conditions affect collective bacterial dynamics, we measured energy spectra and structure functions in dense Bacillus subtilis suspensions in quasi-2D and 3D geometries. Our experimental results for the bacterial flow statistics agree well with predictions from a minimal model for self-propelled rods, suggesting that at high concentrations the collective motion of the bacteria is dominated by short-range interactions. To provide a basis for future theoretical studies, we propose a minimal continuum model for incompressible bacterial flow. A detailed numerical analysis of the 2D case shows that this theory can reproduce many of the experimentally observed features of self-sustained active turbulence.},

Here, we argue that, in many cases, the phenomenology of such active states can be efficiently described in terms of fourth- and higher-order partial differential equations. Structural transitions in these models can be interpreted as Landau-type kinematic transitions in Fourier (wavenumber) space, suggesting that microscopically different biological systems can share universal long-wavelength features. This general idea is illustrated through numerical simulations for two classes of continuum models for incompressible active fluids: a Swift-Hohenberg-type scalar field theory, and a minimal vector model that extends the classical Toner-Tu theory and appears to be a promising candidate for the quantitative description of dense bacterial suspensions. We discuss how microscopic symmetry-breaking mechanisms can enter macroscopic continuum descriptions of collective microbial motion near surfaces, and conclude by outlining future applications. {\textcopyright} IOP Publishing and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

abstract = {Turbulence is a fundamental and ubiquitous phenomenon in nature, occurring from astrophysical to biophysical scales. At the same time, it is widely recognized as one of the key unsolved problems in modern physics, representing a paradigmatic example of nonlinear dynamics far from thermodynamic equilibrium.Whereas in the past, most theoretical work in this area has been devoted to Navier Stokes flows, there is now a growing awareness of the need to extend the research focus to systems with more general patterns of energy injection and dissipation. These include various types of complex fluids and plasmas, as well as active systems consisting of self-propelled particles, like dense bacterial suspensions. Recently, a continuum model has been proposed for such "living fluids" that is based on the NavierStokes equations, but extends them to include some of the most general terms admitted by the symmetry of the problem [Wensink HH, et al. (2012) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 109:1430814313]. This introduces a cubic nonlinearity, related to the TonerTu theory of flocking, which can interact with the quadratic NavierStokes nonlinearity. We show that as a result of the subtle interaction between these two terms, the energy spectra at large spatial scales exhibit power laws that are not universal, but depend on both finite-size effects and physical parameters. Our combined numerical and analytical analysis reveals the origin of this effect and even provides a way to understand it quantitatively. Turbulence in active fluids, characterized by this kind of nonlinear self-organization, defines a new class of turbulent flows.},

Using numerical simulations, I demonstrate that an incompressible turbulent flow, in two-dimensional active nematics, consists of an ensemble of vortices whose areas are exponentially distributed within a range of scales. Building on this evidence, I construct a mean-field theory of active turbulence by which several measurable quantities, including the spectral densities and the correlation functions, can be analytically calculated. Because of the profound connection between the flow geometry and the topological properties of the nematic director, the theory sheds light on the mechanisms leading to the proliferation of topological defects in active nematics and provides a number of testable predictions. A hypothesis, inspired by Onsager's statistical hydrodynamics, is finally introduced to account for the equilibrium probability distribution of the vortex sizes.},

In a system with mass density $\rho$, viscosity µ, mean active stress $\sigma$0, characteristic self-propulsion speed v0, Frank elastic constant K and ow-alignment parameter $\lambda$ with magnitude {\textless} 1, a state with macroscopically aligned direction of self-propulsion displays two linear instabilities governed by the dimensionless combination R $\rho$v02/2$\sigma$0. For R {\textless} R1 = 1 + $\lambda$ disturbances at small wavenumber q grow at a rate q[(R1 R)$\sigma$0/2$\rho$]1/2, which can be viewed as the inertial continuation of the Stokesian instability [PRL 89, 058101 (2002)] of active liquid crystals. The resulting statistical steady state is found numerically to be isotropic hedgehog-defect turbulence. For R1 {\textless} R {\textless} R2 µ2R1/4K$\rho$ a distinct linear instability arises, with growth rate q2 R R1 1/2µ/$\rho$ for R R1 and q2 R R2 µ/$\rho$ for R R2. Direct numerical solution in the parameter range of this O(q2) instability however reveals a phase-turbulent but aligned state. R = R1 thus marks an inertia-driven phase transition from the statistically isotropic phase to a noisy but ordered ock. We present numerical evidence in three and two dimensions for continuous order-parameter onset and a growing correlation length of uctuations upon approaching the transition. Linear stability analysis and direct numerical solution agree that the dominant instability mode for extensile systems is twist, which is three-dimensional; contractile systems fail two-dimensionally. We highlight striking statistical di erences between the resulting turbulent states.

We systematically map the phase diagram of the 3D flow of bacterial suspensions over a large control parameter space spanned by bacterial concentration, the swimming speed of bacteria and the number fraction of active swimmers and delineate the phase boundary between the disordered phase and the turbulent phase. The diagram quantitatively agrees with a simple model balancing hydrodynamic interactions with rotational diffusion of bacteria. We further identify two different kinetic pathways towards bacterial turbulence. Near the phase boundary, one-step transitions with long incubation periods are observed, whereas two-step transitions driven by a long-wavelength instability are found deep inside the turbulent phase. The microscopic origin of these unusual kinetics is finally discussed. Our experiments verify the key predictions of existing theories on transition points and the mode of instability and reveal unexpected kinetic features of nonequilibrium phase transitions in active matter.},

abstract = {Active matter exhibits various forms of nonequilibrium states in the absence of external forcing, including macroscopic steady-state currents. Such states are often too complex to be modeled from first principles, and our understanding of their physics relies heavily on minimal models. These are mostly studied in the case of "dry"active matter, where particle dynamics are dominated by friction with their surroundings. Significantly less is known about systems with long-range hydrodynamic interactions that belong to "wet"active matter. Dilute suspensions of motile bacteria, modeled as self-propelled dipolar particles interacting solely through long-ranged hydrodynamic fields, are arguably the most studied example from this class of active systems. Their phenomenology is well established: At a sufficiently high density of bacteria, there appear large-scale vortices and jets comprising many individual organisms, forming a chaotic state commonly known as bacterial turbulence. As revealed by computer simulations, below the onset of collective motion, the suspension exhibits very strong correlations between individual microswimmers stemming from the long-ranged nature of dipolar fields. Here, we demonstrate that this phenomenology is captured by the minimal model of microswimmers. We develop a kinetic theory that goes beyond the commonly used mean-field assumption and explicitly takes into account such correlations. Notably, these can be computed exactly within our theory. We calculate the fluid velocity variance, spatial and temporal correlation functions, the fluid velocity spectrum, and the enhanced diffusivity of tracer particles. We find that correlations are suppressed by particle self-propulsion, although the mean-field behavior is not restored even in the limit of very fast swimming. Our theory is not perturbative and is valid for any value of the microswimmer density below the onset of collective motion. This work constitutes a significant methodological advance and allows us to make qualitative and quantitative predictions that can be directly compared to experiments and computer simulations of microswimmer suspensions.},

Post-exposure, the boundary re-shapes and erodes due to self-emergent collective flows. We demonstrate that the active-passive boundary acts as a diffuse interface with mechanical properties set by the flow.
