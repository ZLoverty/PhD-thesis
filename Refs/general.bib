@article{Martin1972,
abstract = {A unified hydrodynamic theory is presented that is appropriate for crystals; smectic, cholesteric, and nematic liquid crystals; glasses; and normal fluids. In the theory, the increased spatial degeneracy as the system progresses from crystalline and mesomorphic phases to the isotropic fluid phase is marked by successive reductions in the number of firstorder elastic constants and in the number of transport coefficients. Distinction between local lattice dilations and local mass changes, and recognition of processes like vacancy diffusion that this difference makes possible, are crucial for understanding the connection between theories in different phases. Formulas are derived that give the number of hydrodynamic modes and the frequencies, lifetimes, and intensities of these modes in all of the above systems. In the nematic and cholesteric phases, the results agree with some found previously. In more complex systems, they are new. An attempt is made to explain the differences between the present hydrodynamic theory and other phenomenological proposals. {\textcopyright} 1972 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Curatolo2020,
abstract = {Self-organization is a prerequisite of biological complexity. At the population level, it amounts to spontaneously sorting different individuals through space and time. Here, we reveal a simple mechanism by which different populations of motile cells can self-organize through a reciprocal control of their motilities. We first show how the reciprocal activation of motility between two populations of engineered Escherichia coli makes an initially mixed population of cells segregate, leading to out-of-phase population oscillations without the need of any preexisting positional or orientational cues. By redesigning the interaction, the original segregation between the two populations can be turned into co-localization. We account for this self-organization using a theoretical model that shows the reciprocal control of motility to be a robust and versatile self-organization pathway in multi-component systems. We finally show how our theoretical and experimental results can be generalized to three interacting bacterial populations.},

@article{Turner2000,
abstract = {Bacteria swim by rotating flagellar filaments that are several micrometers long, but only about 20 nm in diameter. The filaments can exist in different polymorphic forms, having distinct values of curvature and twist. Rotation rates are on the order of 100 Hz. In the past, the motion of individual filaments has been visualized by dark-field or differential- interference-contrast microscopy, methods hampered by intense scattering from the cell body or shallow depth of field, respectively. We have found a simple procedure for fluorescently labeling cells and filaments that allows recording their motion in real time with an inexpensive video camera and an ordinary fluorescence microscope with mercury-arc or strobed laser illumination. We report our initial findings with cells of Escherichia coli. Tumbles (events that enable swimming cells to alter course) are remarkably varied. Not every filament on a cell needs to change its direction of rotation: different filaments can change directions at different times, and a tumble can result from the change in direction of only one. Polymorphic transformations tend to occur in the sequence normal, semicoiled, curly 1, with changes in the direction of movement of the cell body correlated with transformations to the semicoiled form.},

@article{Drescher2011,
abstract = {Bacterial processes ranging from gene expression to motility and biofilm formation are constantly challenged by internal and external noise. While the importance of stochastic fluctuations has been appreciated for chemotaxis, it is currently believed that deterministic long-range fluid dynamical effects govern cell - cell and cell - surface scattering - the elementary events that lead to swarming and collective swimming in active suspensions and to the formation of biofilms. Here, we report direct measurements of the bacterial flow field generated by individual swimming Escherichia coli both far from and near to a solid surface. These experiments allowed us to examine the relative importance of fluid dynamics and rotational diffusion for bacteria. For cell - cell interactions it is shown that thermal and intrinsic stochasticity drown the effects of long-range fluid dynamics, implying that physical interactions between bacteria are determined by steric collisions and near-field lubrication forces. This dominance of short-range forces closely links collective motion in bacterial suspensions to self-organization in driven granular systems, assemblages of biofilaments, and animal flocks. For the scattering of bacteria with surfaces, long-range fluid dynamical interactions are also shown to be negligible before collisions; however, once the bacterium swims along the surface within a few microns after an aligning collision, hydrodynamic effects can contribute to the experimentally observed, long residence times. Because these results are based on purely mechanical properties, they apply to a wide range of microorganisms.},
