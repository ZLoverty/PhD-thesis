abstract = {A simple model with a novel type of dynamics is introduced in order to investigate the emergence of self-ordered motion in systems of particles with biologically motivated interaction. In our model particles are driven with a constant absolute velocity and at each time step assume the average direction of motion of the particles in their neighborhood with some random perturbation (g) added. We present numerical evidence that this model results in a kinetic phase transition from no transport (zero average velocity, {\~{}}v, ( = 0) to finite net transport through spontaneous symmetry breaking of the rotational {\~{}} symmetry. The transition is continuous, since {\~{}}v, is found to scale as (71, —g)t with p = 0.45},

Dense populations of such "active particles" or "swimmers" exhibit a rich collective behavior at large scales. Starting with a minimal physical model of a stroke-averaged swimmer in a fluid, we derive a continuum description of a suspension of active organisms that incorporates fluid-mediated, longrange hydrodynamic interactions among the swimmers. Our work demonstrates that hydrodynamic interactions provide a simple, generic origin for several nonequilibrium phenomena predicted or observed in the literature. The continuum model derived here does not depend on the microscopic physical model of the individual swimmer. The details of the large-scale physics do, however, differ for "shakers" (particles that are active but not self-propelled, such as melanocytes) and "movers" (self-propelled particles), "pushers" (most bacteria) and "pullers" (algae like Chlamydomonas). Our work provides a classification of the large-scale behavior of all these systems.},

abstract = {The emergence of collective motion exhibited by systems ranging from flocks of animals to self-propelled microorganisms to the cytoskeleton is a ubiquitous and fascinating self-organization phenomenon1-12. Similarities between these systems, such as the inherent polarity of the constituents, a density-dependent transition to ordered phases or the existence of very large density fluctuations13-16, suggest universal principles underlying pattern formation. This idea is followed by theoretical models at all levels of description: micro-or mesoscopic models directly map local forces and interactions using only a few, preferably simple, interaction rules 12,17-21, and more macroscopic approaches in the hydrodynamic limit rely on the systems' generic symmetries8,22,23. All these models characteristically have a broad parameter space with a manifold of possible patterns, most of which have not yet been experimentally verified. The complexity of interactions and the limited parameter control of existing experimental systems are major obstacles to our understanding of the underlying ordering principles13. Here we demonstrate the emergence of collective motion in a high-density motility assay that consists of highly concentrated actin filaments propelled by immobilized molecular motors in a planar geometry. Above a critical density, the filaments self-organize to form coherently moving structures with persistent density modulations, such as clusters, swirls and interconnected bands. These polar nematic structures are long lived and can span length scales orders of magnitudes larger than their constituents. Our experimental approach, which offers control of all relevant system parameters, complemented by agent-$\beta$ased simulations, allows backtracking of the assembly and disassembly pathways to the underlying local interactions. We identify weak and local alignment interactions to be essential for the observed formation of patterns and their dynamics. The presented minimal polar-pattern-forming system may thus provide new insight into emerging order in the broad class of active fluids8,23,24 and selfpropelled particles17,25. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

While transport phenomena in a suspension have been studied extensively, how energy is transported from the individual cell scale to the larger mesoscale remains unclear. In this study, we carry out the first successful measurement of the three-dimensional velocity field in a dense suspension of bacteria. The results show that most of the energy generated by individual bacteria dissipates on the cellular scale. Only a small amount of energy is transported to the mesoscale, but the gain in swimming velocity and mass transport due to mesoscale coherent structures is enormous. These results indicate that collective swimming of bacteria is efficient in terms of energy. This paper sheds light on how energy can be transported toward smaller wave numbers in the Stokes flow regime. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

On the example of aerobic bacteria Bacillus subtilis, we report on spatial and temporal correlation functions measurements of collective state for various swimming speeds and concentrations. The experiments produced a puzzling result: while the energy injection rate is proportional to the swimming speed and concentration, the correlation length remains practically constant upon small speeds where random tumbling of bacteria dominates.

While different possible scenarios can be considered to account for these observations-such as a generic velocity weakening instability recently put forward-we show that the experimental results are reproduced mathematically by a chemotactic aggregation mechanism, originally introduced to account for bacterial aggregation and accounting here for diffusiophoretic chemical interaction between colloidal swimmers. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {With remarkable precision and reproducibility, cells orchestrate the cooperative action of thousands of nanometre-sized molecular motors to carry out mechanical tasks at much larger length scales, such as cell motility, division and replication. Besides their biological importance, such inherently non-equilibrium processes suggest approaches for developing biomimetic active materials from microscopic components that consume energy to generate continuous motion. Being actively driven, these materials are not constrained by the laws of equilibrium statistical mechanics and can thus exhibit sought-after properties such as autonomous motility, internally generated flows and self-organized beating. Here, starting from extensile microtubule bundles, we hierarchically assemble far-from-equilibrium analogues of conventional polymer gels, liquid crystals and emulsions. At high enough concentration, the microtubules form a percolating active network characterized by internally driven chaotic flows, hydrodynamic instabilities, enhanced transport and fluid mixing. When confined to emulsion droplets, three-dimensional networks spontaneously adsorb onto the droplet surfaces to produce highly active two-dimensional nematic liquid crystals whose streaming flows are controlled by internally generated fractures and self-healing, as well as unbinding and annihilation of oppositely charged disclination defects. The resulting active emulsions exhibit unexpected properties, such as autonomous motility, which are not observed in their passive analogues. Taken together, these observations exemplify how assemblages of animate microscopic objects exhibit collective biomimetic properties that are very different from those found in materials assembled from inanimate building blocks, challenging us to develop a theoretical framework that would allow for a systematic engineering of their far-from-equilibrium material properties. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {From the formation of animal flocks to the emergence of coordinated motion in bacterial swarms, populations of motile organisms at all scales display coherent collective motion. This consistent behaviour strongly contrasts with the difference in communication abilities between the individuals. On the basis of this universal feature, it has been proposed that alignment rules at the individual level could solely account for the emergence of unidirectional motion at the group level. This hypothesis has been supported by agent-based simulations. However, more complex collective behaviours have been systematically found in experiments, including the formation of vortices, fluctuating swarms, clustering and swirling. All these (living and man-made) model systems (bacteria, biofilaments and molecular motors, shaken grains and reactive colloids) predominantly rely on actual collisions to generate collective motion. As a result, the potential local alignment rules are entangled with more complex, and often unknown, interactions. The large-scale behaviour of the populations therefore strongly depends on these uncontrolled microscopic couplings, which are extremely challenging to measure and describe theoretically. Here we report that dilute populations of millions of colloidal rolling particles self-organize to achieve coherent motion in a unique direction, with very few density and velocity fluctuations. Quantitatively identifying the microscopic interactions between the rollers allows a theoretical description of this polar-liquid state. Comparison of the theory with experiment suggests that hydrodynamic interactions promote the emergence of collective motion either in the form of a single macroscopic 'flock', at low densities, or in that of a homogenous polar phase, at higher densities. Furthermore, hydrodynamics protects the polar-liquid state from the giant density fluctuations that were hitherto considered the hallmark of populations of self-propelled particles. Our experiments demonstrate that genuine physical interactions at the individual level are sufficient to set homogeneous active populations into stable directed motion. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

The dynamic assembly results from a competition between self-propulsion of particles and an attractive interaction induced respectively by osmotic and phoretic effects and activated by light. We measured a transition from normal to giant-number fluctuations. Our experiments are quantitatively described by simple numerical simulations.

abstract = {Self-sustained dynamical phases of living matter can exhibit remarkable similarities over a wide range of scales, from mesoscopic vortex structures in microbial suspensions and motility assays of biopolymers to turbulent large-scale instabilities in flocks of birds or schools of fish. Here, we argue that, in many cases, the phenomenology of such active states can be efficiently described in terms of fourth- and higher-order partial differential equations. Structural transitions in these models can be interpreted as Landau-type kinematic transitions in Fourier (wavenumber) space, suggesting that microscopically different biological systems can share universal long-wavelength features. This general idea is illustrated through numerical simulations for two classes of continuum models for incompressible active fluids: a Swift-Hohenberg-type scalar field theory, and a minimal vector model that extends the classical Toner-Tu theory and appears to be a promising candidate for the quantitative description of dense bacterial suspensions. We discuss how microscopic symmetry-breaking mechanisms can enter macroscopic continuum descriptions of collective microbial motion near surfaces, and conclude by outlining future applications. {\textcopyright} IOP Publishing and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

Active nematics are a fundamentally different class of liquid crystals, driven away from equilibrium by the autonomous motion of their constituent rod-like particles. This internally generated activity powers the continuous creation and annihilation of topological defects, which leads to complex streaming flows whose chaotic dynamics seem to destroy long-range order. Here, we study these dynamics in experimental and computational realizations of active nematics. By tracking thousands of defects over centimetre-scale distances in microtubule-based active nematics, we identify a non-equilibrium phase characterized by a system-spanning orientational order of defects. This emergent order persists over hours despite defect lifetimes of only seconds. Similar dynamical structures are observed in coarse-grained simulations, suggesting that defect-ordered phases are a generic feature of active nematics.},

abstract = {Turbulence is a fundamental and ubiquitous phenomenon in nature, occurring from astrophysical to biophysical scales. At the same time, it is widely recognized as one of the key unsolved problems in modern physics, representing a paradigmatic example of nonlinear dynamics far from thermodynamic equilibrium.Whereas in the past, most theoretical work in this area has been devoted to Navier Stokes flows, there is now a growing awareness of the need to extend the research focus to systems with more general patterns of energy injection and dissipation. These include various types of complex fluids and plasmas, as well as active systems consisting of self-propelled particles, like dense bacterial suspensions. Recently, a continuum model has been proposed for such "living fluids" that is based on the NavierStokes equations, but extends them to include some of the most general terms admitted by the symmetry of the problem [Wensink HH, et al. (2012) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 109:1430814313]. This introduces a cubic nonlinearity, related to the TonerTu theory of flocking, which can interact with the quadratic NavierStokes nonlinearity. We show that as a result of the subtle interaction between these two terms, the energy spectra at large spatial scales exhibit power laws that are not universal, but depend on both finite-size effects and physical parameters. Our combined numerical and analytical analysis reveals the origin of this effect and even provides a way to understand it quantitatively. Turbulence in active fluids, characterized by this kind of nonlinear self-organization, defines a new class of turbulent flows.},

abstract = {A hierarchy of timescales is ubiquitous in biological systems, where enzymatic reactions play an important role because they can hasten the relaxation to equilibrium. We introduced a statistical physics model of interacting spins that also incorporates enzymatic reactions to extend the classic model for allosteric regulation. Through Monte Carlo simulations and theoretical analysis, we found that the relaxation dynamics are much slower than the elementary reactions and are logarithmic in time with several plateaus, as is commonly observed for glasses. This is because of the kinetic constraints from the cooperativity via the competition between enzymes, which tend to bind to molecules with the limited structure. This inhibits the progress of the modification reaction. Our model showed symmetry breaking in the relaxation trajectories that led to inherently kinetic phase transitions without any correspondence to the equilibrium state. In this paper, we discuss the relevance of these results for diverse responses in biology.},

It arises in animate soft-matter systems as diverse as bacterial baths 2 , cell tissues 3 and reconstituted cytoskeletal preparations 4 . However, the way that these turbulent dynamics emerge in active systems has so far evaded experimental scrutiny. Here, we unveil a direct route to active nematic turbulence by demonstrating that, for radially aligned unconfined textures, the characteristic length scale emerges at the early stages of the instability. We resolve two-dimensional distortions of a microtubule-based extensile system 5 in space and time, and show that they can be characterized in terms of a growth rate that exhibits quadratic dependence on a dominant wavenumber. This wavelength selection mechanism is justified on the basis of a continuum model for an active nematic including viscous coupling to the adjacent fluid phase. Our findings are in line with the classical pattern-formation studies in non-active systems 6 , bettering our understanding of the principles of active self-organization, and providing potential perspectives for the control of biological fluids.},

Such system sizes enable us to obtain quantitative information about both the transition to active turbulence and characteristic features of the turbulent state itself. In the dilute limit, we test analytical predictions for a number of static and dynamic properties against our simulation results.

For R {\textless} R1 = 1 + $\lambda$ disturbances at small wavenumber q grow at a rate q[(R1 R)$\sigma$0/2$\rho$]1/2, which can be viewed as the inertial continuation of the Stokesian instability [PRL 89, 058101 (2002)] of active liquid crystals.

Direct numerical solution in the parameter range of this O(q2) instability however reveals a phase-turbulent but aligned state. R = R1 thus marks an inertia-driven phase transition from the statistically isotropic phase to a noisy but ordered ock. We present numerical evidence in three and two dimensions for continuous order-parameter onset and a growing correlation length of uctuations upon approaching the transition. Linear stability analysis and direct numerical solution agree that the dominant instability mode for extensile systems is twist, which is three-dimensional; contractile systems fail two-dimensionally. We highlight striking statistical di erences between the resulting turbulent states. Finally, for R {\textgreater} R2, a state of polar uniaxial alignment is stable to small perturbations at all wavenumbers q.},

Using genetically engineered light-powered E. coli whose locomotion can be reversibly controlled by light, we study the emergence of collective bacterial swimming, a phenomenon often refereed to as bacterial turbulence. Bacterial turbulence is triggered in our experiments by adjusting light intensity, allowing for real-time imaging of the onset of collective motions in concentrated bacterial suspensions. We systematically map the phase diagram of the 3D flow of bacterial suspensions over a large control parameter space spanned by bacterial concentration, the swimming speed of bacteria and the number fraction of active swimmers and delineate the phase boundary between the disordered phase and the turbulent phase. The diagram quantitatively agrees with a simple model balancing hydrodynamic interactions with rotational diffusion of bacteria. We further identify two different kinetic pathways towards bacterial turbulence. Near the phase boundary, one-step transitions with long incubation periods are observed, whereas two-step transitions driven by a long-wavelength instability are found deep inside the turbulent phase. The microscopic origin of these unusual kinetics is finally discussed. Our experiments verify the key predictions of existing theories on transition points and the mode of instability and reveal unexpected kinetic features of nonequilibrium phase transitions in active matter.},

abstract = {At high cell concentrations, bacterial suspensions are known to develop a state of collective swimming (the "zooming bionematic phase," or ZBN) characterized by transient, recurring regions of coordinated motion greatly exceeding the size of individual cells. Recent theoretical studies of semidilute suspensions have suggested that long-range hydrodynamic interactions between swimming cells are responsible for long-wavelength instabilities that lead to these patterns, while models appropriate for higher concentrations have suggested that steric interactions between elongated cells play an important role in the self-organization. Using particle imaging velocimetry in well-defined microgeometries, we examine the statistical properties of the transition to the ZBN in suspensions of Bacillus subtilis, with particular emphasis on the distribution of cell swimming speeds and its correlation with orientational order. This analysis reveals a nonmonotonic relationship between mean cell swimming speed and cell concentration, with a minimum occurring near the transition to the ZBN. Regions of high orientational order in the ZBN phase have locally high swimming speeds, while orientationally disordered regions have lower speeds. A model for steric interactions in concentrated suspensions and previous observations on the kinetics of flagellar rebundling associated with changes in swimming direction are used to explain this observation. The necessity of incorporating steric effects on cell swimming in theoretical models is emphasized. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Despite their inherently non-equilibrium nature, living systems can self-organize in highly ordered collective states that share striking similarities with the thermodynamic equilibrium phases of conventional condensed-matter and fluid systems. Examples range from the liquid-crystal-like arrangements of bacterial colonies, microbial suspensions and tissues to the coherent macro-scale dynamics in schools of fish and flocks of birds. Yet, the generic mathematical principles that govern the emergence of structure in such artificial and biological systems are elusive. It is not clear when, or even whether, well-established theoretical concepts describing universal thermostatistics of equilibrium systems can capture and classify ordered states of living matter. Here, we connect these two previously disparate regimes: through microfluidic experiments and mathematical modelling, we demonstrate that lattices of hydrodynamically coupled bacterial vortices can spontaneously organize into distinct patterns characterized by ferro- and antiferromagnetic order. The coupling between adjacent vortices can be controlled by tuning the inter-cavity gap widths. The emergence of opposing order regimes is tightly linked to the existence of geometry-induced edge currents, reminiscent of those in quantum systems. Our experimental observations can be rationalized in terms of a generic lattice field theory, suggesting that bacterial spin networks belong to the same universality class as a wide range of equilibrium systems.},

Using an established modification of the Navier-Stokes equation that accounts for the small-scale forcing of hydrodynamic flow by microswimmers, we study the properties of a dense suspension of microswimmers in two dimensions, where the conservation of enstrophy can drive an inverse cascade through which energy is accumulated on the largest scales.

@article{Wolgemuth2008,
abstract = {To swim, a bacterium pushes against the fluid within which it is immersed, generating fluid flow that dies off on a length scale comparable to the size of the bacterium. However, in dense colonies of bacteria, the bacteria are close enough that flow generated by swimming is substantial. For these cases, complex flows can arise due to the interaction and feedback between the bacteria and the fluid. Recent experiments on dense populations of swimming Bacillus subtilis have revealed a volume fraction-dependent transition from random swimming to transient jet and vortex patterns in the bacteria/fluid mixture. The fluid motions that are observed are reminiscent of flows that are observed around translating objects at moderate to high Reynolds numbers. In this work, I present a two-phase model for the bacterial/fluid mixture. The model explains turbulent flows in terms of the dipole stress that the bacteria exert on the fluid, entropic elasticity due to the rod shape of each bacterium, and the torque on the bacteria due to fluid gradients. Solving the equations in two dimensions using realistic parameters, the model reproduces empirically observed velocity fields. Dimensional analysis provides scaling relations for the dependence of the characteristic scales on the model parameters. {\textcopyright} 2008 by the Biophysical Society.},

We develop a novel kinetic theory that captures these correlations and is nonperturbative in the swimmer density. To provide an experimentally accessible measure of correlations, we calculate the diffusivity of passive tracers and reveal its nontrivial density dependence.

@article{Hohenegger2010,
abstract = {We study theoretically the stability of "active suspensions," modeled here as a Stokesian fluid in which are suspended motile particles. The basis of our study is a kinetic model recently posed by Saintillan and Shelley where the motile particles are either "pushers" or "pullers." General considerations suggest that, in the absence of diffusional processes, perturbations from uniform isotropy will decay for pullers, but grow unboundedly for pushers, suggesting a possible ill-posedness. Hence, we investigate the structure of this system linearized near a state of uniform isotropy. The linearized system is nonnormal and variable coefficient, and not wholly described by an eigenvalue problem, in particular at small length scales. Using a high wave-number asymptotic analysis, we show that while long-wave stability depends on the particular swimming mechanism, short-wave stability does not and that the growth of perturbations for pusher suspensions is associated not with concentration fluctuations, as we show these generally decay, but with a proliferation of oscillations in swimmer orientation. These results are also confirmed through numerical simulation and suggest that the basic model is well-posed, even in the absence of translational and rotational diffusion effects. We also consider the influence of diffusional effects in the case where the rotational and translational diffusion coefficients are proportional and inversely proportional, respectively, to the volume concentration and predict the existence of a critical volume concentration or system size for the onset of the long-wave instability in a pusher suspension. We find reasonable agreement between the predictions of our theory and numerical simulations of rodlike swimmers by Saintillan and Shelley. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Subramanian2009,
abstract = {We examine the stability of a suspension of swimming bacteria in a Newtonian medium. The bacteria execute a run-and-tumble motion, runs being periods when a bacterium on average swims in a given direction; runs are interrupted by tumbles, leading to an abrupt, albeit correlated, change in the swimming direction. An instability is predicted to occur in a suspension of 'pushers' (e.g. E. Coli, Bacillus subtilis, etc.), and owes its origin to the intrinsic force dipoles of such bacteria. Unlike the dipole induced in an inextensible fibre subject to an axial straining flow, the forces constituting the dipole of a pusher are directed outward along its axis. As a result, the anisotropy in the orientation distribution of bacteria due to an imposed velocity perturbation drives a disturbance velocity field that acts to reinforce the perturbation. For long wavelengths, the resulting destabilizing bacterial stress is Newtonian but with a negative viscosity. The suspension becomes unstable when the total viscosity becomes negative. In the dilute limit (nL3 1), a linear stability analysis gives the threshold concentration for instability as (nL3)crit = ((30/C G{\{}script{\}}(r))(Dr L/U)(1 + 1/(6$\tau$Dr)))/(1 - (15G{\{}script{\}}(r)/Cℱ(r)) (DrL/U)(1 + 1/(6$\tau$Dr))) for perfectly random tumbles; here, L and U are the length and swimming velocity of a bacterium, n is the bacterial number density, Dr characterizes the rotary diffusion during a run and $\tau$-1 is the average tumbling frequency. The function ℱ(r) characterizes the rotation of a bacterium of aspect ratio r in an imposed linear flow; ℱ(r) = (r2 - 1)/(r2 + 1) for a spheroid, and ℱ(r) ≈ 1 for a slender bacterium (r {\textgreater} 1). The function G{\{}script{\}}(r) characterizes the stabilizing viscous response arising from the resistance of a bacterium to a deforming ambient flow; G{\{}script{\}}(r) = 5$\pi$/6 for a rigid spherical bacterium, and G{\{}script{\}}(r)≈ $\pi$/45 (ln r) for a slender bacterium. Finally, the constant C denotes the dimensionless strength of the bacterial force dipole in units of $\mu$U L2; for E. Coli, C ≈ 0.57. The threshold concentration diverges in the limit ((15G{\{}script{\}}(r)/C ℱ(r)) (DrL/U) (1 + 1/(6$\tau$Dr))) → 1. This limit defines a critical swimming speed, Ucrit = (Dr L)(15G{\{}script{\}}(r)/C ℱ(r))(1 + 1/(6$\tau$Dr)). For speeds smaller than this critical value, the destabilizing bacterial stress remains subdominant and a dilute suspension of these swimmers therefore responds to long-wavelength perturbations in a manner similar to a suspension of passive rigid particles, that is, with a net enhancement in viscosity proportional to the bacterial concentration. On the other hand, the stability analysis predicts that the above threshold concentration reduces to zero in the limit Dr → 0, $\tau$ → ∞, and a suspension of non-interacting straight swimmers is therefore always unstable. It is then argued that the dominant effect of hydrodynamic interactions in a dilute suspension of such swimmers is via an interaction-driven orientation decorrelation mechanism. The latter arises from uncorrelated pair interactions in the limit nL3 1, and for slender bacteria in particular, it takes the form of a hydrodynamic rotary diffusivity (Drh); for E. Coli, we Drh = 9.4 × 10-5 (nUL2). From the above expression for the threshold concentration, it may be shown that even a weakly interacting suspension of slender smooth-swimming bacteria (r ≫ 1, ℱ(r) ≈ 1, $\tau$ → ∞) will be stable provided Drh {\textgreater} (C/30) (nUL2) in the limit nL3 1. The hydrodynamic rotary diffusivity of E. Coli is, however, too small to stabilize a dilute suspension of these swimmers, and a weakly interacting suspension of E. Coli remains unstable. {\textcopyright} 2009 Cambridge University Press.},

We examined the motion of swarming Escherichia coli, comparing the motion of individual cells to their motion during swimming. Swarming cells' speeds are comparable to bulk swimming speeds, but very broadly distributed. Their speeds and orientations are correlated over a short distance (several cell lengths), but this correlation Is not isotropic. We observe the swirling that Is conspicuous in many swarming systems, probably due to increasingly long-lived correlations among cells that associate into groups. The normal run-tumble behavior seen in swimming chemotaxis is largely suppressed, instead, cells are continually reoriented by random jostling by their neighbors, randomizing their directions in a few tenths of a second. At the edge of the swarm, cells often pause, then swim back toward the center of the swarm or along its edge. Local alignment among cells, a necessary condition of many flocking theories, is accomplished by cell body collisions and/or shortrange hydrodynamic interactions. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the Biophysical Society.},

We simultaneously measure orientation and velocity fields and show that the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of our system can be quantitatively reproduced by a type of microscopic model for active suspensions whose important parameters are all estimated from comprehensive experimental data. This provides unprecedented access to key effective parameters and mechanisms governing active nematics. Our approach is applicable to different types of dense suspensions and shows a path toward more quantitative active matter research.},

abstract = {The study of collective motion in bacterial suspensions has been of significant recent interest. To better understand the non-trivial spatio-temporal correlations emerging in the course of collective swimming in suspensions of motile bacteria, a simple model is employed: a bacterium is represented as a force dipole with size, through the use of a short-range repelling potential, and shape. The model emphasizes two fundamental mechanisms: dipolar hydrodynamic interactions and short-range bacterial collisions. Using direct particle simulations validated by a dedicated experiment, we show that changing the swimming speed or concentration alters the time scale of sustained collective motion, consistent with experiment. Also, the correlation length in the collective state is almost constant as concentration and swimming speed change even though increasing each greatly increases the input of energy to the system. We demonstrate that the particle shape is critical for the onset of collective effects. In addition, new experimental results are presented illustrating the onset of collective motion with an ultrasound technique. This work exemplifies the delicate balance between various physical mechanisms governing collective motion in bacterial suspensions and provides important insights into its mesoscopic nature. {\textcopyright} IOP Publishing and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

@article{Ezhilan2013,
abstract = {Suspensions of active particles, such as motile microorganisms and artificial microswimmers, are known to undergo a transition to complex large-scale dynamics at high enough concentrations. While a number of models have demonstrated that hydrodynamic interactions can in some cases explain these dynamics, collective motion in experiments is typically observed at such high volume fractions that steric interactions between nearby swimmers are significant and cannot be neglected. This raises the question of the respective roles of steric vs hydrodynamic interactions in these dense systems, which we address in this paper using a continuum theory and numerical simulations. The model we propose is based on our previous kinetic theory for dilute suspensions, in which a conservation equation for the distribution function of particle configurations is coupled to the Stokes equations for the fluid motion [D. Saintillan and M. J. Shelley, "Instabilities, pattern formation, and mixing in active suspensions," Phys. Fluids20, 123304 (2008)]10.1063/1.3041776. At high volume fractions, steric interactions are captured by extending classic models for concentrated suspensions of rodlike polymers, in which contacts between nearby particles cause them to align locally. In the absence of hydrodynamic interactions, this local alignment results in a transition from an isotropic base state to a nematic base state when volume fraction is increased. Using a linear stability analysis, we first investigate the hydrodynamic stability of both states. Our analysis shows that suspensions of pushers, or rear-actuated swimmers, typically become unstable in the isotropic state before the transition occurs; suspensions of pullers, or head-actuated swimmers, can also become unstable, though the emergence of unsteady flows in this case occurs at a higher concentration, above the nematic transition. These results are also confirmed using fully nonlinear numerical simulations in a periodic cubic domain, where pusher and puller suspensions are indeed both found to exhibit instabilities at sufficiently high volume fractions; these instabilities lead to unsteady chaotic states characterized by large-scale correlated motions and strong density fluctuations. While the dynamics in suspensions of pushers are similar to those previously reported in the dilute regime, the instability of pullers is novel and typically characterized by slower dynamics and weaker hydrodynamic velocities and active input power than in pusher suspensions at the same volume fraction. {\textcopyright} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

@article{Peng2015,
abstract = {The microscopic kinetics of ubiquitous solid-solid phase transitions remain poorly understood. Here, by using single-particle-resolution video microscopy of colloidal films of diameter-tunable microspheres, we show that transitions between square and triangular lattices occur via a two-step diffusive nucleation pathway involving liquid nuclei. The nucleation pathway is favoured over the direct one-step nucleation because the energy of the solid/liquid interface is lower than that between solid phases. We also observed that nucleation precursors are particle-swapping loops rather than newly generated structural defects, and that coherent and incoherent facets of the evolving nuclei exhibit different energies and growth rates that can markedly alter the nucleation kinetics. Our findings suggest that an intermediate liquid should exist in the nucleation processes of solid-solid transitions of most metals and alloys, and provide guidance for better control of the kinetics of the transition and for future refinements of solid-solid transition theory.},
